You can only abandon them and start over or provide hospice to those that are dying.<br />\nShe explains that because all systems are living system, as big systems peak, you start to get walkouts or the trailblazers who leave the dominant system in order to pursue a new and healthier system. For example, forty years ago as industrial agriculture was peaking, a small number of people in lots of different places started to seek out and provide local and organic food.  If walkouts stay isolated from each other, the existing system crushes them.  But as walkouts start to get connected with other walkouts, they can create a new, better system that can start to challenge the existing system.<br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1896 size-large\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/If-you-are-a-walkout-1024x512.png\" alt=\"if-you-are-a-walkout\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" /><br />\nMany entrepreneurs are trailblazers, and we all go through moments of doubt, fear, frustration and loneliness.  Inventing something and getting it to work is really hard.  Scaling it into a thriving business is even harder, no matter what problem you are trying to solve. Entrepreneurs who are focused on sustainability, wellbeing, social impact or positive business face the unique challenge of being walkout trailblazers inside an emerging system that itself isn&#8217;t yet understood, and is often overlooked or written off as niche.  Fortunately, I see signs of that changing.  Nationally, organizations like the <a href=\"https://michiganross.umich.edu/about/positive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ross School of Positive Business</a> at the University of Michigan, the<a href=\"http://svn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Social Venture Network</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B Corp movement</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.investorscircle.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Investors Circle</a> are pulling together communities of innovators to provide human, financial and customer capital to define the new system of business. In WeSpire&#8217;s own backyard, the <a href=\"http://www.necec.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Northeast Clean Energy Council</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.masscec.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Massachusetts Clean Energy Center</a>, <a href=\"http://cevg.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CEVG</a>, the <a href=\"http://bostonimpact.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boston Impact Initiative</a>, and <a href=\"http://reinventurecapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reinvesture Capital </a>are focusing on the strength of the local Boston ecosystems.<br />\nHere at WeSpire we have had the privilege of working with some very large corporations to be part of the teams that are helping transform everything about how they do business.  These corporations are questioning everything, from their supply chain, to what products they sell, to who they work with and more. These organizations may be seen as trailblazers, walking away from the conventional system of doing business to seek a new and healthier way of running a business. Another theory is that these large companies are in fact what Deborah calls Protectors in the theory of change.  They are deep inside the established systems and use their power and influence to provide oases for innovation to take place and to support the emergence of the new system.<br />\nWhat do you think?  Can an organization that&#8217;s been around for 100+ years become a Walkout? If yes, what companies do you think are doing this level of trailblazing?   Who are the protectors?<br />\n<em>Disclosure: CEVG, Boston Impact Initiative and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center are all investors in WeSpire.</em><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_1899\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1899\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jTdZSPBRRE\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1899\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Deborah-Frieze-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Watch Debora Frieze's TedX Talk\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1899\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jTdZSPBRRE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Watch Debora Frieze&#8217;s TedX Talk</a></figcaption></figure></p>\n","slug":"tedx-talk-became-localist","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"4bd0105b-41ed-5621-91c2-9c6601525f31"}}}
