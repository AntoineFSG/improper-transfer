Here&#8217;s what you told us.<!--more--><br />\nThe physical, emotional and social benefits have been <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/the-power-of-gratitude/\">proven time over time</a>, but how many of us actually purposely practice gratitude in our daily lives?<br />\nThe good news is that the majority of people we surveyed have successfully made gratitude a habit in their lives. Over 50% of those surveyed say they count their blessings for what they have more than once a week.

One respondent said, There are good things and bad things that happen in each of our lives. What we choose to focus on is our choice. I choose the good and I&#8217;m grateful.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are very few words more powerful in the English language than: Thank you. &#8212; Survey Respondent.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We were interested to see if those who are less content with what they have would think that expressing gratitude isn&#8217;t as important. However, we were pleasantly surprised to find that everyone surveyed agreed that it is important to appreciate the good things in life &#8216; even those who say they are less content with what they have in their life. When given the chance to comment on gratitude, one respondent said that it&#8217;s important to, Recognize when things are good so you know when things are not so good, how good you&#8217;ve had it. Interestingly, even those who said they never count their blessings for what they have, still believe in the importance of appreciating the good things in life.<br />\nIt&#8217;s easier to appreciate the impact that your friends and family have on your life, but expressing gratitude at work doesn&#8217;t come as naturally for most. Over half of respondents said that they express thanks or gratitude to others at work often but just 17% say they do it daily.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/survey-says-gratitude-important-habit/gratitude-at-work/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2032\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2032 size-large\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Gratitude-at-work-1024x538.png\" alt=\"gratitude-at-work\" width=\"640\" height=\"336\" /></a><br />\nOur survey may be closed, but <a href=\"http://ctt.ec/dXql9\">tweet at us</a>, and let us know what gratitude means to you and the importance that it plays in your daily life.</p>\n","slug":"survey-says-gratitude-important-habit","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"70e76cc5-d064-5070-8f65-c3e66470b33b"}}}
