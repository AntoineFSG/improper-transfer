Andrew is dedicated to helping companies both large and small use sustainability engagement strategies to grow, create enduring value and build stronger relationships with employees, customers and other stakeholders. His clients have included Bank of America, Bayer, HP, Pepsi, Boeing and IKEA. And for the purpose of full disclosure, we are proud to say that Andrew is also one of our beloved and trusted advisors.</p>\n<h5 class=\"p1\"><strong>1) In your new book, <em>The Big Pivot</em>, you discuss the importance of managers and executives fighting the pressure of short-term performance. What are some examples of strategies managers and executives have used to make shareholder needs and sustainability compatible?</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p4\">The myth is that shareholder needs and sustainability aren&#8217;t already compatible. They are. What&#8217;s not compatible is maximizing short-term earnings <em>only</em> and also tackling big, shared environmental and social challenges. The problem is not trying to create shareholder value, but how we&#8217;ve defined it in recent years to mean only the shortest term and only earnings. Businesses must invest and in many ways create real, sustained value &#8216; and that&#8217;s about any kind of innovation, not just for what we call sustainability. But the financial community&#8217;s short-term focus is making it much harder.  So fighting this pressure is frankly, not easy. A few leaders are changing the conversation with Wall Street and telling them explicitly how their sustainability work creates value for the company. Others are just avoiding the quarterly conversations with those investors that only focus on short-term stock movements. Companies can also rethink how they make investments and use tools like ROI to take into account other forms of value (see below).</p>\n<h5 class=\"p4\"><strong>2) Given that the average tenure of CEOs is continually becoming shorter term, is it reasonable to ask them to think in terms of the long-term when they might not be around to see it through? </strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p4\">It&#8217;s not an unfair question given the pressures CEOs face to produce quickly, but it&#8217;s also odd to assume that a CEO should only be concerned with how the company does during his or her tenure. Shouldn&#8217;t the person in the top job be looking down the road for what will keep the company thriving, or what could trip it up, over time?  A company is a structure specifically made to outlast any individual, so operating it as if it&#8217;s there to only support the current leaders is kind of absurd.</p>\n<h5 class=\"p4\"><strong>3) For those companies in your book that you mention, such as Unilever, Nike and Walmart, what were the driving forces internally that allowed them to holistically embrace sustainability?</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p4\">That&#8217;s always a hard question to answer. Some would say that every company that has led in some dimension had some scare &#8216; Nike and child labor 20 years ago, or Walmart and community resistance to their business model and tactics. And this is almost certainly true, but not surprising &#8216; it&#8217;s often the near heart attack or health scare that make us radically change our eating or exercise habits. But beyond that, it&#8217;s always hard to say what drives key individuals to change and see the big picture. Some see a movie or read a book that shapes them. Others go on trips to the rain forest or arctic to see first hand how the world is changing. And many tell me their kids or grandkids asked them something or talked to them about the future.  These companies are also getting pressure from their own employees, who want to work for a place that shares their values. But all of that said, the reason companies like this really embrace these efforts is that it&#8217;s profitable &#8216; it&#8217;s good for business.</p>\n<h5 class=\"p4\"><strong>4) What is the fastest ROI you have seen for a company that decides to engage in sustainability? What was the innovation?</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p3\">There&#8217;s no single way to answer that. Engaging in sustainability&#8217; covers an awful lot of territory. There&#8217;s a huge range of initiatives that companies can do that pay off very, very quickly &#8216; particularly in the realm of eco-efficiency. For example, many companies have changed lighting technologies and experience paybacks in weeks or months. Or consider the example I describe in my book about Diageo, the spirits giant. In North America, the company cut carbon by 75% in a few years. They found ways to cut by 50% with what they called low or no cost&#8217; options, including things like&#8230;realizing that one distillery had two boilers running and it could make do with one. This is the industrial equivalent of turning off the lights when you leave the room. The payback period is zero days. So the quickest payback innovations are instantaneous.</p>\n<h5 class=\"p4\"><strong>5) Can you think of any examples of companies that would not benefit from embracing sustainability engagement strategies?</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p4\">The shifts that the world requires &#8216; away from fossil fuels for example &#8216; will create winners and losers. This is the old capitalist creative destruction at its most basic. So pure-play coal companies will not survive the seismic changes in the works. But diversified energy companies, if they embraced the realities we face, could become energy companies, not oil and gas entities. The challenge again is short versus long-term thinking. Those companies at the center of the status quo make historic sums of money doing things the way they do them now. Embracing this shift will be better in the longer-run, but could cause some pain in the short-run. But beyond the fossil fuel companies and a few other examples, nearly every company will benefit. In tactical terms, doing more with less saves money, for example &#8216; or using renewable energy creates resilience and lowers risks (and also increasingly lowers costs). And at the macro level, companies benefit because we can&#8217;t have thriving businesses without a thriving planet or society as well. Sustainability, or whatever we want to call it, is not some separate pursuit, but critical to our ability to survive and thrive.</p>\n<h5 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>6) </strong></span><strong>In your book, you emphasize the need of businesses to do more with less, and use existing resources. We think employees are an opportunity for using an existing resource when it comes to changing a company in a positive way. How do you see employee engagement playing a part in helping companies make the <em>Big Pivot</em>?</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p4\">Employees are absolutely critical to the Big Pivot. We need innovation at all levels of the company, which requires people in every role to ask new questions. But we also need employees to keep the pressure on top executives to make the shifts required. As we&#8217;ve talked about here, the external pressure on leaders is intense. If they hear the message clearly that people want to move the company to make the pivot needed, and that those employees will bring their best selves to work to make it happen, it can help executives see the larger business case. And engagement means a better, more productive, more fun place to work &#8216; who wouldn&#8217;t want that?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p4\"><em><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\" alignleft wp-image-335\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire sustainability engagement strategies blog\" width=\"134\" height=\"47\" /></a>Like what you read?
