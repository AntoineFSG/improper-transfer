At WeSpire, we are extremely fortunate to have a number of amazing teammates, all working to bring purpose to employees at companies, large and small, around the world.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every once in awhile we like to shine the spotlight on one member of the WeSpire team and give you a peek into the remarkable workforce behind our award winning employee engagement platform.</span></h4>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please say Hello to one of our newest team members, Olivia D&#8217;Angelo, our Customer Success Intern, whom I had the pleasure of sitting down with for this special spotlight interview.</span></h4>\n<p><b>Hannah: What are the top 5 most-used apps on your phone?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Insight Timer (a meditation timer), Aaptiv (a fitness app), Snapchat, Google Calendar, and Spotify.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Favorite song and why?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I Wanna Get Better by Bleachers because I really like their style of music and the song is about self-improvement, so it&#8217;s very easy to run or workout to.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: If you were in charge, what would you fix?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I would improve the U.S. food system and try to make more connections between farmers and retail locations. I feel like there is a disconnect between people who grow the food and people who bring it to consumers.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Do you prefer sweet or savory?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Savory!</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What&#8217;s your favorite way to save money?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I like the site DoYogaWithMe.com because it allows me to do yoga at home for free! </span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What would constitute a perfect day for you?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I would do something active, like go on a hike, where I would feel accomplished. After, I would make dinner with friends and go to a small live music venue with them.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: If you were to die and come back as a different person, who would it be?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dan Barber! He was featured on the show Chef&#8217;s Table and he has a collegiate background in English and Writing, but he became a Chef. He&#8217;s really focused on making sustainable food that is appealing to everyone. He&#8217;s the chef at the restaurant called Blue Hill Stone Barns in New York City!</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What is your dream job?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, I want to be a data scientist. But more specifically, I want to have a job where I can do analysis, but also be outside and do something in nature or on a farm.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What&#8217;s your favorite quote/mantra?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I really like the This Is Water essay by David Foster Wallace. He used it in a commencement speech about living a compassionate life and I remember watching that after I graduated college and wishing I had a commencement speech like that.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What&#8217;s your ideal pet?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I just want a giant Bernese Mountain Dog, but I&#8217;m allergic!</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Who is your role model and why?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I really like Amy Poehler because she is obviously very funny and smart, but she is also very self-reflective. Her </span><a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/kaitlin-at-the-mall/n11863?snl=1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaitlin skit from SNL</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of my all time favorites.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I feel strongly about certain things, like food additives, reading food labels, and antibiotics, but I don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s anything that can&#8217;t be joked about.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Favorite place and why?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parque Patagonia. I was there last year with my best friend and it was a really life changing and cool trip. It is one of the new parks that the founders of Patagonia opened and there have only been a couple hundred people who have visited. It was a very adventurous experience!</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What was your motivation for joining WeSpire?</b><br />\n<b>Olivia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I definitely wanted to get involved in a company that has sustainability values and I loved the idea that there could be a project that impacts these habits on a larger scale.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mad lib bio:</span><br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olivia D&#8217;Angelo</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hails from </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glastonbury, Connecticut</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
