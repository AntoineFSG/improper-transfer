For example, the Fogg model and the Engaging Leader Behavior Model will provide the backbone of your program by harnessing employee motivators and enablers. However, it is critical to apply Tipping Point Leadership theory at the beginning of your program to successfully generate momentum among your employees. <strong>Main takeaway:</strong> when designing an engagement program, different theories come into play at different stages, and it is prudent to use each to your advantage.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3048361/most-creative-people/how-to-make-company-culture-stick?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+fastcompany%2Fheadlines+%28Fast+Company%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Make Company Culture Stick</a></h3>\n<p>Employees at a startup seem to promote and embody company culture easily: a young workplace provides them with the opportunity to shape the way the company views work and its workers. Yet, there are a few corporate giants that are unique in the fact that they too, continue to <strong><em>think like a startup.</em></strong> Cue InMobi, the India-based mobile ad giant that still embodies the tenants of its start-up roots. Through carefully-planned events, such as company-wide hackathon challenge days, and an active company culture that has been boldly labeled <a href=\"http://www.inmobi.com/yawio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YaWio</a>, InMobi managers <em>foster innovation and weave creative thinking</em> into their employees&#8217; daily routines. InMobi&#8217;s success has not gone unnoticed by its peers: managers from other corps are seeking out their methods when designing their own culture programs.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/why-startups-should-build-social-good-into-their-dna\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why startups should build social good into their DNA</a></h3>\n<p>How do you attract and retain employees, improve public perception of your company, and increase sales? Implement CSR initiatives at your organization, of course. Fortune 500 giants like Dell have been successful at this for quite some time now, but they are not the only organizations that can benefit: <em><strong>fresh entrepreneurs who think about CSR programs from Day 1 have the opportunity to embed social programs into their business models</strong></em>, ensuring that the programs stick long-term and stay true to doing the right thing. Intrepid leaders at TOMS, Mealshare, and Scribendi have known and succeeded at this tactic, proving to the skeptics that startups can do it&#8217;and do it profitably, too.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3048503/hit-the-ground-running/6-surprising-insights-of-successful-employee-engagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6 Surprising Insights of Successful Employee Engagement</a></h3>\n<p>The topic of employee engagement has gained enough traction in recent years to be one of the highest priorities for companies around the world.

To attract the next generation of workers, organizations might want to consider having flexible hours programs for employees. With access to technology virtually everywhere, Millennials come to expect managers to give them the trust to do their work wherever and whenever they want. Companies like Polycom Inc. have found this approach to not only reap better products from their employees but also a significant cost benefit: employee turnover rates have dropped, and the culture shift to promoting work-life balance has increased engagement levels. What&#8217;s more, happy Millennials can become your greatest asset in recruiting for new positions.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\" wp-image-335 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire blog image\" width=\"175\" height=\"62\" /></a>Visit the <a href=\"/blog\">WeSpire blog</a> and subscribe to get the latest employee engagement articles delivered straight into your inbox.</p></blockquote>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-weekly-news-roundup-7172015","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"9a0702ce-0783-5cf7-9b7e-4304cd06227e"}}}
