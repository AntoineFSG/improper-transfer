People and&#8217;Sustainability. According to a new report from <a title=\"The Conference Board\" href=\"https://www.conference-board.org/ceo-challenge/\">The Conference Board</a>, Human Capital and Sustainability are both among the top five concerns for global CEOs in 2015. Leaders are constantly challenged to find great talent and keep it; and this year, for the first time, social and environmental sustainability is a high priority. Winners value their employees thoughtfully, much as they value customers. They&#8217;ll leverage the best emerging technology and trends for their work-life balance programs and a more engaged workforce.<br />\nThese were some of the key themes discussed at <a href=\"http://www.oraclehcmworld.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oracle&#8217;s HCM World 2015 Conference</a>, where I participated recently.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nFor three fascinating days, attendees focused on the positive, disruptive change that&#8217;s happening in forward-thinking corporations around the world. Seventy-five percent of HR professionals say their model today is flawed and poses a challenge to their ability to compete for top talent. Massive organizations like Oracle, Accenture, Deloitte, Ford, and IBM are transforming old models of employee recruiting, engagement, and growth.<br />\nHow? With social employee-centric platforms that curate content, drive collaboration, and build reputation networks among global workforces; and which encourage participation, sharing, and aim to replicate a start-up&#8217;s culture of purpose, camaraderie, and positive energy. Enterprise models are shifting to embrace mobile, social, transparent and multi-channel communications that are ubiquitous in everyday life. Seminal moments that matter provide opportunities to connect with people throughout their careers, especially among millennials.<br />\nThe speaker line-up was world-class and inspiring, including Oracle&#8217;s Mark Hurd, Chris Leone, Cara Capretta, and Mark Bennett; Kraig Eaton of Accenture; Professor Dave Ulrich of the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan; and keynote speaker Dr. Condoleeza Rice, who provided a truly global context focused on the importance of education and unwavering leadership.<br />\nBennett moderated the Balance, Integration, Blend? Cutting Through the Work-Life Knot panel that I participated in. He expertly pushed me and my fellow panelists to define familiar challenges for 2015 and to identify new solutions, especially those activated by technology innovations and efficiencies.<br />\nWe all concentrated on the urgent problem of unengaged employees. As Fast Company explains it, half of full-time workers in the U.S. are somewhere in the twilight zone: not fully engaged and involved at work, and yet not totally switched off. They&#8217;re just there. And that&#8217;s a big deal. C-suite leaders need to be genuinely and actively interested in their employees. This includes knowing what matters in their lives and careers. The word purpose is key to sustaining high levels of employee engagement and never more so than now, where pressing global issues impact us all. People want their organizations to provide experiences via the workplace that inject real meaning and value. Everyone, including &#8216; and notably &#8216; Millennials, want their leaders to get it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>From WeSpire&#8217;s perspective, the smartest companies are the ones that provide employees with ample opportunity to participate in initiatives that boost enthusiasm and drive desired business outcomes. The workplace can provide a robust engagement mix via technology and on the ground &#8216; everything from tasty snacks and life coaches to ping-pong tournaments and community service trips in other hemispheres. Ultimately, it depends on each organization&#8217;s distinctive values and DNA.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The challenge of employee engagement demands creative, authentic, innovative resourcefulness and commitment from the world&#8217;s top executives. Where to begin? Sometimes it&#8217;s simply a matter of convening a group of creative thought-leaders for a few days of uninterrupted focus and then send them back to work.
