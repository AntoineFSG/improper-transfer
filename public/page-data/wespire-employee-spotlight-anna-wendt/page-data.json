It&#8217;s a really catchy song!<br />\n<strong><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2104\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Image-uploaded-from-iOS-300x293.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Wendt WeSpire\" width=\"300\" height=\"293\" />Q:</strong> <strong>What do you appreciate most about your childhood?</strong><br />\nI really appreciate how close my family was when I was growing up. My parents, two siblings and I are all still really close now.<br />\n<strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Tell us about your favorite teacher/coach/adult figure growing up. Why did they inspire you then, and what have you realized about them now?</strong><br />\nMy AP environmental science teacher, who I had during my senior of high school, opened my eyes to the field of environmental studies. Because of this teacher, I chose to study marketing and finance with a minor in sustainable business, and I&#8217;m dedicated to working for a sustainable business or business that makes a positive impact on the environment. Regardless of my career path, this teacher gave me a better understanding of how I, as an individual, can reduce, re-use and recycle to make the world a little more sustainable.<br />\n<strong>Q:</strong> <strong>You have to go on vacation for two weeks, all expenses paid. Where to?</strong><br />\nNantucket. I go there every year with my family and it&#8217;s my favorite place in the world. We&#8217;ve been going there as a family since 2000 and it&#8217;s our one week a year getaway. Sometimes we go with family friends or other family members. Regardless of our company, it&#8217;s our time to relax, unplug and enjoy the warm weather and the beach.<br />\n<strong> Q: What&#8217;s the best Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG) you ever heard of, and whose was it? <em>(</em></strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal\"><strong><em>examples</em></strong></a><strong><em>, for inspiration)</em></strong><br />\nJFK&#8217;s Moon Challenge: While this is an old example, I think the psychology behind it is intriguing. This was partially a competition between the US and Russia, but I think that at the time, I lot of people were skeptical about what science could accomplish and don&#8217;t trust the data in a way that they trust a human being. I believe that achieving that goal opened up more doors in science and it also gave a lot of children some new dreams!<br />\n<strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What&#8217;s your favorite new vocabulary word?</strong><br />\nThey&#8217;re not new words, but I&#8217;ve been throwing Italian words, like ciao, into my vocabulary. I studied abroad in Rome and just returned a month or so ago. It can&#8217;t hurt to bring a little bit of Italy into my everyday vocabulary!<br />\n<strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What&#8217;s your favorite meal you made recently?</strong><br />\nI made an Italian dish, Caccio e Pepe, for my roommates and I and added saut ed kale. It was SO good.<br />\n<strong>Q: Signature cocktail?</strong><br />\nMargarita. On the rocks.<br />\n<strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Ideal date night?</strong><br />\nDepending on the season it would either be going to an amusement park or going ice skating.<br />\n<strong>Q: What would constitute a perfect day for you?</strong><br />\nOn a perfect day, I would wake up around 10:00 in the morning, and then head out to meet my friends for brunch. Afterward, I would just walk around and explore Boston. Maybe I&#8217;d go shopping on Newbury or at least window shopping, and then walk around the Boston Common. I&#8217;d then head home, make myself dinner, get together with friends and then go out to a bar &#8216; preferably a country bar.<br />\n<strong>Q:</strong> <strong>If you were to die and come back as a person or thing, what do you think it would be?</strong><br />\nI&#8217;d want to be a dog. Life would be so easy! You run around and sleep &#8216; my dog sleeps all day. Also, everyone loves you!<br />\n<strong> </strong><strong>Q: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?</strong><br />\nI would want willpower to stop myself from eating all of the delicious snacks at WeSpire!<br />\n<strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Favorite thing about working at WeSpire?</strong><br />\nThe people! It&#8217;s a welcoming environment, which as a new person, is super helpful.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>#Throwback Mad Libs Style:<br />\n<u>Anna Wendt </u>was born in <u>Burlington, VT</u>.
