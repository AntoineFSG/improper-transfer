Where?</b><br />\n<b>Avery:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Argentina because it would allow me to complete my travel to all 7 continents! I really would travel to any of the countries in South America, but there are just so many different landscapes that can be seen in Argentina&#8230;I would really travel to any country in the world!</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Do you prefer sweet or savory?</b><br />\n<b>Avery:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sweet.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What&#8217;s your favorite motivation quote/mantra?</b><br />\n<b>Avery: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration -Thomas Edison.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What&#8217;s your signature dessert?</b><br />\n<b>Avery:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Anything that&#8217;s peanut butter and chocolate.

It wouldn&#8217;t be too hot, around 80 degrees. I would lounge around, get some ice cream, maybe play some beach volleyball or badminton and be surrounded by my friends and family.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?</b><br />\n<b>Avery: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ability to fly because it would allow me to see all of the beautiful wonders of the world easily and affordably and with the option to go wherever I please.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What do you appreciate most about your childhood?</b><br />\n<b>Avery: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How supportive my parents were and how they encouraged me to be outside every second that I could.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What&#8217;s your ideal pet?</b><br />\n<b>Avery: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">horse. Since I was a child, I have always loved horses and how majestic they are and how freeing it can be to ride them &#8211; I have read books on books about horses both fictional and nonfictional since I was a child. I can picture this being my mid-life crisis.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Did you have a favorite teacher or role model growing up?</b><br />\n<b>Avery:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Mrs. Henault from elementary school. I was probably the only one in my class that loved her because she challenged us a lot and it required us to work hard, but I was an overachiever so I loved that. </span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What&#8217;s a favorite meal that you cooked recently?</b><br />\n<b>Avery:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Eggplant parm. </span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Coffee or tea?</b><br />\n<b>Avery: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tea.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Favorite thing about working at WeSpire?</b><br />\n<b>Avery:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I love how everyone is extremely enthusiastic, has a lot of the same interests as me, and are very motivated to progress the company forward. </span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><strong>Mad lib bio snapshot:</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color: #333333;\"> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avery Palardy</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> grew up in </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smithfield, Rhode Island</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
