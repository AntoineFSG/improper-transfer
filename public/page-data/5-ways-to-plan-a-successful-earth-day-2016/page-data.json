Why not celebrate all month long! <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resources/\">WeSpire&#8217;s customers</a> often reboot environmentally focused programs right now, fueled by data collected during the previous year. As more and <a href=\"http://there100.org/news/14206601/\">more companies</a> set their organizational muscle behind carbon reductions, efficiency, and positive impacts, you naturally want to galvanize people to do their part. We understand!<br />\nHere are 5 ways to plan for a successful Earth Day at your organization.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Map the objectives.</strong> Invite one or two interested work friends to brainstorm ideas and decide what you will accomplish. Set one goal, or three, but not so many that your Earth Day campaign becomes a big shaggy green monster. Be realistic, not audacious, about what you can expect to achieve. Choose activities that fit well with your culture.</li>\n<li><strong>Gather a team.</strong> Enthusiastic, earth-minded people are indispensable for leading activities (more on those in a moment). Get them together, perhaps over your favorite local craft beer. Share your ideas, and find out what theirs are.</li>\n<li><strong>Make a Plan.</strong> Agree on goals, activities, and a timeline for your Earth Day event. Be sure to divide tasks among all members of the team. That way you won&#8217;t burn out, and you&#8217;ll enjoy Earth Day more. Assign roles and responsibilities, publicize to your co-workers, and have fun!</li>\n<li><strong>Get the word out.</strong> You can create the best, most impactful, super-fun Earth Day event, but unless you tell people about it you won&#8217;t be successful. Develop a communication plan that is both online and offline to make sure as many people are aware as possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Follow up.</strong> Wrap your Earth Day with fun facts about participation and results. Post stories of success on your social channels and publish star contributors in the news. Convene your team to rehash what went well, lessons learned, and to plan future events.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>P.S. get primed for Earth Day and Earth Month by participating on <a href=\"https://www.earthhour.org/\">Earth HOUR 2016</a> this weekend!
