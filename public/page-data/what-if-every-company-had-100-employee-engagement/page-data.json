Sustainability employee engagement was a key topic in the Organizational Development &amp; Intrapreneurship track, but also was highlighted in several other tracks including Leadership &amp; Strategy, Stakeholder Insights &amp; Influences, and Brand Positioning &amp; Communications.<!--more--><br />\n<strong>Not surprising, given that actively disengaged employees cost the United State $550 billion per year in lost productivity</strong> (Source: <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/services/178514/state-american-workplace.aspx\">Gallup</a>).</p>\n<h4><strong>Employee engagement is critical to sustainability</strong></h4>\n<p>Why is the engagement topic so popular and so critical at SB&#8217;14? It&#8217;s likely because engagement is a core, bedrock component of a sustainable brand. A truly sustainable brand is transparent, open and readily engages in a dialogue with stakeholders, whether employees, supply chain, customers, investors or the communities they impact. Dialogue is more likely to lead to understanding, which can lead to action. That action can lead to change for the better for the brand, the business and the stakeholders. <strong>But sustainability employee engagement isn&#8217;t easy to do well and it&#8217;s really hard to measure. </strong></p>\n<h4><strong>Innovative solutions abound</strong></h4>\n<p>We were pleased to host a number of group conversations on this subject, hearing from <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx\">Microsoft</a> about how cascading a <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft-green/archive/2013/09/10/microsoft-s-carbon-offset-strategy-making-a-difference-one-project-at-a-time.aspx\">carbon fee</a> through to departments has increased interest in carbon-reducing programs. We heard from <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/\">eBay</a> about how linking social innovation, greener commerce and community engagement together has broadened interest in their programs. We got booth visitors from <a href=\"http://www.hm.com/us/\">H&amp;M</a> to <a href=\"http://shop.panasonic.com/\">Panasonic</a> thinking about what they could achieve if every single employee viewed their business through a sustainability lens. My favorite quote?</p>\n<blockquote><p>A hundred percent of our employees engaged in sustainability? Wow, it would be amazing!! But I don&#8217;t think we are even remotely prepared for what it could do&#8217;</p></blockquote>\n<h4><strong>The journey towards 100%</strong></h4>\n<p>Besides these conversations, some of the panels highlighted some amazing work in the field, both academic and practical. My personal favorite was from researcher Stephanie Bertels of the Beedie School of Business at Simon Fraser University in Canada. She is doing a <a href=\"http://nbs.net/community/embedding-sustainability-working-group\">three-year research project</a> to examine what companies are doing to embed sustainability throughout their organizations. Specifically, she&#8217;s looking at how this work changes as they move along their journey and to develop ways to assess the impacts of their efforts along the way. Her assessment tool is fascinating and would be extremely useful to determine where to target specific engagement initiatives.<br />\nSo what would it be like if every employee were engaged in your company?</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><a href=\"/resource/the-state-of-employee-engagement-in-sustainability-csr\"><img class=\"  wp-image-276 alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2014-Research-Report-LP-Image-for-website-225x300.png\" alt=\"2014 Research Report LP Image for website\" width=\"101\" height=\"135\" /></a>Download WeSpire&#8217;s recent research report <a href=\"/resource/the-state-of-employee-engagement-in-sustainability-csr\">The State of Employee Engagement in Sustainability &amp; Corporate Social Responsibility</a> to learn more about how employees across the U.S. are engaged to drive positive impact.</em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"what-if-every-company-had-100-employee-engagement","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"ab67a19d-d581-5c6c-a919-f209d209f7df"}}}
