The debate over where we work has transitioned into the debate about <strong><em>how</em></strong> we work, and as a result, new terminology has emerged to discuss these ideas. Catchphrases like <em>employee engagement</em>, <em>radical transparency, digital nomads,</em> and <em>gig economy</em> are becoming commonplace, and it is prudent for managers to know how to approach them and discuss them in an educated manner. Read on to see how the author breaks down new terminology in the employee engagement sphere.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://ebn.benefitnews.com/news/retirement/employers-out-of-touch-with-employee-perception-of-benefits-2746964-1.html\">Employers out of touch with employee perception of benefits</a></h3>\n<p>American employees and employers are facing a costly disconnect in how they each view corporate benefits plans. <a href=\"https://www.guardiananytime.com/gafd/wps/wcm/connect/f589df46-9ea7-4e45-9aca-58e2f37cc80d/The_Guardian_Workplace_Benefits_Study.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research</a> from The Guardian shows that <em><strong>only 16% of employers believe they are responsible for providing benefits to employees</strong></em>, but nearly 2 out of 3 employees see their employers as obligated to provide benefits. What&#8217;s more, 42% of the employees surveyed rely on their employers to provide most or all of their resources for financial security, and often don&#8217;t have forms of insurance outside work. In the workplaces that do offer financial security, the plans are not often communicated clearly to employees, and thus, they are underutilized. It&#8217;s time for employers to open up these communication lines so that their workers can get the most from what they have to offer.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248648\">Reality Check: 5 Things You Need to Realize About Your Employees</a></h3>\n<p>Keeping in touch with your employees is a crucial component of employee engagement, yet managers might not always see underlying problems from routine interactions with their teams. The statistics are not in favor of employers: according to <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-tips/talent-trends-global\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn&#8217;s 2015 Talent trends</a>, <strong><em>nearly 1 in 3 employees are actively seeking a new position</em></strong>.

If you focus improvement efforts in the 5 ways the article outlines, you will become the rock star employer of your team&#8217;s dreams.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/3475103/banking-and-capital-markets-corporations/csr-reporting-is-on-the-rise-and-so-is-its-impact.html?ArticleId=3475103#.VbuKRkJVikp\">CSR Reporting Is on the Rise, and So Is Its Impact</a></h3>\n<p>A fresh report from finance experts at the Zicklin School of Business have shared findings that firms in environmentally sensitive industries, such as oil, gas, mining, and weapons production, present higher stock valuations when they publish extensive CSR reports. The catch, however, is that organizations must follow through on communicating these CSR initiatives to the public: apparently, it is not enough to just embody best practices. The benefits of releasing these statements, too, extends beyond higher stock valuations: reporting on environmental, social, and governance factors can indicate that the organization will be more proactive in managing the risks associated with them.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://upstart.bizjournals.com/resources/executive-forum/2015/07/29/happy-hour-and-catered-lunch-perks-are-ok-but-here.html?page=all\">Happy hour and catered lunch perks are OK, but here&#8217;s how to stand out</a></h3>\n<p>How do you differentiate yourself from all other employers trying to attract and retain top talent?

Fostering employee loyalty requires managers to do more than throw benefits at their employees. Instead, organizations need to be strategic in offering wellness perks to employees in order to generate greater employee engagement and motivation.
