These fleeting months are filled with vacations, days at the beach or by the pool and late night BBQs &#8216; but where does work fit in when it comes to your employees&#8217; summer priorities?<!--more--><br />\nWith employees cycling in and out of the office because of vacations, motivation, energy and productivity can all easily drop. While some organizations theorize that they should put their <a href=\"http://www.snacknation.com/blog/employee-wellbeing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">employee engagement efforts</a> on hold during the summer months, we actually encourage you to ramp them up.<br />\nHere are five employee engagement programs you can implement to keep your employees engaged, motivated and excited to come to work all throughout the summer.<br />\n<strong>Offer Volunteer Opportunities</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/5-reasons-volunteering-boosts-engagement/\">Volunteering</a> is a great way for employees to switch up their everyday routine, and connect with other co-workers outside of the office. Find volunteer events that allow employees to enjoy the outdoors and support their local community.<br />\n<strong>Host a Social Event</strong><br />\nThe summer months can be tough with people traveling, working remotely, and managing their busy schedules. Company events provide an opportunity for employees to meet colleagues that they normally may not get to know. Keep the events casual and optional. Employees shouldn&#8217;t feel forced into the event!<br />\n<strong>Start a Summer Spots League</strong><br />\nMany cities offer community leagues for every sport you can imagine. Create a few company teams, and invite your employees to join in. It&#8217;s a great way to socialize outside of the office, get your employees <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/is-your-wellness-program-effective/\">active</a>, and encourage them to bond outside of the office.<br />\n<strong>Offer Flexible Schedules and Vacation Policies</strong><br />\nStudies show that when you provide employees with flexible work schedules, they are happier, less stressed and are more engaged in their work. The same holds true for <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3052926/lessons-learned/we-offered-unlimited-vacation-for-one-year-heres-what-we-learned\">unlimited vacation</a> policies. In fact, research shows employees actually end up taking less vacation time with unlimited vacation policies compared to more restrictive policies!<br />\n<strong>Plan a Retreat for the End of Summer </strong><br />\nOnce employees are settled back into their routines and the kids are back to school, find time to bring everyone together and reinvigorate them! Having a company wide retreat is an excellent way to welcome everyone back, give company updates, and motivate your employees towards accomplishing key company goals before year end.<br />\n<em>Already have a summer engagement plan?
