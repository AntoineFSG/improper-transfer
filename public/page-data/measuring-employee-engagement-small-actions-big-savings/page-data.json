So what are the biggest sustainability trends in employee engagement we saw this summer? Of the 20 actions that generated the biggest waste, water, emissions, fuel and energy savings, <strong>60% were commuting and travel related</strong>. Whether at work, or at the beach, WeSpire users are making a significant impact.<!--more--></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To begin, let&#8217;s take a look at travel-related actions of employees using WeSpire&#8217;s platform:</p>\n<h4>Give the car a rest</h4>\n<p>During summer, it&#8217;s a little more enticing to get out of the car and take public transportation, walk, or bike to work &#8216; and together, these three actions generated about $7 in environmental savings per user &#8216; that&#8217;s in addition to the gas money saved! [Note: all numbers are generated from WeSpire&#8217;s proprietary Impact and Savings Report, which aggregates each individuals&#8217; environmental impact &#8216; energy, fuel, emissions, water and waste &#8216; from corporate employee engagement programs.]</p>\n<h4>Rethink business travel</h4>\n<p class=\"p2\">In addition to commuting, many WeSpire users found ways to reduce their business travel impact through holding virtual meetings and doubling-up meetings when they did take business trips, which saved the average user about $4 (plane ticket savings not included).</p>\n<h4>Green your vacation</h4>\n<p>Summer is also synonymous with vacation, so it may not be a shock to see that many of the most impactful actions were centered on making budget-friendly improvements like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\">Buying a pre-owned car,</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">Upgrading your vehicle&#8217;s fuel economy,</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">Driving instead of flying for a short trip,</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">And taking a staycation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In total, these four actions resulted in about $11 in environmental savings per user this summer.</p>\n<h4>Veg out</h4>\n<p>However, the summer&#8217;s number one most impactful action is one you can keep doing for the rest of the year and beyond: eat a vegetarian meal &#8216; saving the average user about $4 in this summer alone. In fact, if you eat one less burger per week, over the course of a year, it is <a href=\"http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2011/07/19/meat-eaters-guide-easing-climate-change-impacts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equivalent</a> to taking your car off the road for 320 miles or line drying your clothes half the time.</p>\n<h4>This all adds up to some significant impact!</h4>\n<p>So what kind of savings does all this sustainable behavior change add up to? <strong>From June 1 to August 31 of this year, the average WeSpire user saved over $62</strong>, with the most savings coming from actions that reduced energy (nearly $27), and then fuel ($23). When you combine these savings across an entire employee base, that&#8217;s some serious savings on the utility bill.<br />\n<img title=\"Breakdown of savings &amp; impact per user\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/217956/file-1706067011-png/Screen_Shot_2014-09-25_at_4.48.34_PM.png?t=1423778295545\" alt=\"Breakdown of savings &amp; impact per user\" /><br />\nWeSpire users have also drastically changed their behavior in response to the severe and ongoing drought. Through projects like <a href=\"/droughtbusters-the-7-7-million-gallons-of-water-that-didnt-go-down-the-drain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Droughtbusters</a>, which aim to help users find ways and build habits to reduce their water usage, the average user saved over 450 gallons of water, equal to about $7. All those small habit forming actions, like turning the water off while brushing your teeth, actually add up in a big way.<br />\nSo what does this mean for your company? It suggests that in addition to taking on the environmental challenges of today, WeSpire employee engagement programs that focus on building positive habits over time result in sustainable behavior change with real bottom line impact.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><a href=\"/demo\"><img class=\"  alignleft wp-image-128\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fp-featured-content-img-300x152.png\" alt=\"measuring employee engagement demo\" width=\"166\" height=\"84\" /></a><a href=\"/demo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Request a demo</a> to learn more about how the WeSpire employee engagement platform can help you empower your employees to make a measurable, positive impact in sustainability and beyond.</em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"measuring-employee-engagement-small-actions-big-savings","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"6d8cc563-ad78-5b96-8017-2e1298f13d7f"}}}
