Although we know this, we often face a gap between knowing and doing. In this article, key leaders at Aveda Co. and the Alcoa Foundation share their insights about how to <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/webinar-changing-behavior-through-purposeful-work-the-journey-to-100-engagement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">effectively draw in employees</a>. The notable solutions? Link employees to their deep passions, imbue their work with a sense of purpose, utilize the power of social and game mechanics to foster engagement, and most of all, maintain a cultural fit with new programs.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2015/06/22/employee-engagement-strategy/\">The Best Employee Engagement Strategy is from the Bottom Up</a></h3>\n<p>What is the source of the greatest variance in employee engagement levels? That&#8217;s right, managers. You may have thought that it was employee perks and benefits, but in fact, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/182321/employees-lot-managers.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent Gallup research</a> shows that over 70% of the variance in engagement can be attributed to the manager. Thus, even if HR departments can convince C-suite executives to spend budget dollars on employee engagement surveys, if the top execs are the only ones to manage the resulting data, no improvement is gained. Instead, the author contends that each specific department should have its own employee engagement report, and the managers of each team should share the results and facilitate group discussions about them. With open feedback, managers can learn where their own problem areas are, and the group can brainstorm the best way to fix its deficiencies as a whole.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/your-hr-department-is-having-an-identity-crisis\">Your HR Department is having an Identity Crisis</a></h3>\n<p>HR departments across the country are facing a massive transformation as employees are steering away from payroll and benefits, and beginning to champion company culture and individual happiness. When employees are satisfied at work, they are more engaged and less likely to look for alternative employment opportunities. Retaining top talent is huge, as employee turnover costs companies dollars that could be contributing to a more productive cause. Yet, establishing an effective company culture is not always a straightforward task for HR departments, as they can only facilitate employee buy in.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/business/21656218-do-gooding-policies-help-firms-when-they-get-prosecuted-halo-effect\">The Halo Effect</a></h3>\n<p>CSR has been demonstrated to create monetary value for companies, but studies are now showing that it does so in more unconventional ways than you might think: through a halo effect, a company&#8217;s good deeds render it more favorable under legal scrutiny. In the data, among firms up on the legal chopping block, so to speak, those with more comprehensive CSR programs were granted more lenient penalties. Although all forms of CSR were not equal under the judges&#8217; eyes, in general, they promoted more favorable legal outcomes.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-horoszowski/7-researchbacked-ways-you_b_7665214.html\">7 Research-Backed Ways Your Business Will Benefit by Being More Socially Responsible</a></h3>\n<p>More and more consumers are demanding CSR practices among their favorite brands, and impact initiatives are becoming a huge attraction for workers seeking potential employers. As yet another bonus, social good programs like skill-based volunteering have proven to cultivate leadership skills in employees, a trait that is essential in the workplace. Through social good programs, managers can make an impact on employees at any level. The author makes 7 points on how your business can benefit from CSR, but our favorite 3 are that people want to work at companies with world positive missions, employees perform better when they engage in socially responsible activities and reporting, and that it can increase access to capital.
