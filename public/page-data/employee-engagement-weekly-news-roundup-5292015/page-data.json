These applications come in a variety of forms, from emotional monitoring systems to social recognition games. With instantaneous constructive feedback, employers can modify their actions to increase employee engagement levels and promote a positive company culture. With an employee&#8217;s mood correlated so closely to her performance, it is obvious why more and more companies are looking to these technologies for real-time data.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.hrzone.com/perform/people/sleep-deprivation-consequences-in-the-workplace?utm_content=buffer0be88&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">Sleep deprivation consequences in the workplace</a></h3>\n<p>Managers must be increasingly aware of sleep deprivation as the silent productivity killer: studies have shown that the impact of minor sleep deprivation levels on a team of three is equivalent to losing one full-time worker. In growing and large companies alike, this lack of engagement can be extremely detrimental to both product quality and overall company culture. The author contends that managers should be cognizant of the symptoms of sleep deprivation in order to foster employee wellness. More alert, creative employees will boost company productivity, in turn.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/28/business-sustainability-challenges-solutions-apple-tim-cook\">Warts and all: the route to sustainability isn&#8217;t always pretty<br />\n</a></h3>\n<p>It is well-acknowledged that companies experience numerous benefits from shifting towards sustainable alternatives in their routine operations; yet, after declaring intensions to foster sustainable behavior, many do not know where to start. Although the author contends that there isn&#8217;t one clear pathway to sustainable success, one common obstacle is integrating new practices into the company culture. Shifting towards sustainable paradigms requires much effort, but if high-level managers and CEOs publically demonstrate their commitment, other employees will be more likely to follow. Regardless, it&#8217;s time to start talking about the challenges companies face in reaching these goals.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/stakeholder_trends_insights/sustainable_brands/study_81_consumers_say_they_will_make_\">Study: 81% of Consumers Say They Will Make Personal Sacrifices to Address Social, Environmental Issues</a></h3>\n<p>With CSR on the rise, consumers feel more empowered in making a positive impact by choosing products created by companies that demonstrate concern for social and environmental issues. Given the choice, studies show that 89% of respondents would be more likely to purchase from a company with responsible practices. In today&#8217;s competitive market for goods and services, establishing rapport and loyalty with consumers is a necessity. Yet, consumers report that companies today are often opaque in reporting their CSR practices. The silver lining? Opportunities exist for companies to take charge and lead the public CSR conversation.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.triplepundit.com/2015/05/green-initiatives-improve-brands-perceived-value/\">Green Initiatives Improve a Brand&#8217;s Perceived Value</a></h3>\n<p>By committing to sustainable practices and marketing their initiatives to consumers, companies can not only attract and retain customers looking for companies that give back, but they can also save money on their own energy costs. More and more often, once one company in a specific industry boosts revenue via improved sustainability efforts, others in the industry are quick to follow. For the frontrunners, however, it can be a daunting initiative to undertake. The article outlays easy steps to start out, such as measuring energy usage costs, cutting down on paper use, embracing alternative energy, and involving employees by setting conservation goals.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\"  wp-image-335 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire blog image\" width=\"175\" height=\"62\" /></a>Visit the <a href=\"/blog\">WeSpire blog</a> and subscribe to get the latest employee engagement articles delivered straight into your inbox.</p></blockquote>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-weekly-news-roundup-5292015","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"5331aced-21e3-5242-9045-35de034c3381"}}}
