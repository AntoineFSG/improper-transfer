Timberland first launched their highly successful employee volunteer program, Timberland&#8217;s Path of Service, in 1992. Since then Timberland employees have served more than one million hours in communities worldwide.<br />\nAt this week&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.sustainatopia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sustainatopia</a> conference, Atlanta McIlwraith, senior manager of community engagement at Timberland, spoke about the success of the Path of Service program, sharing that employees have historically cited the program as one of the primary reasons they choose to continue working at Timberland.<br />\nTimberland, along with many companies who provide paid time off for volunteering, allow employees to find volunteer causes they&#8217;re passionate about, but they also plan two large-scale company driven volunteer events for employees.<br />\nCompany-driven volunteer events are a great way to bring your employees together and into the community for a good cause, but there&#8217;s no doubt that these events are a ton of work. Depending on the scale of your corporate volunteer event you could be coordinating hundreds or even thousands of volunteers, multiple location sites, vendors, forms, transportation &#8216; the list goes on.<br />\nOur new, free <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/volunteer-event-planning-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Volunteer Event Planning Template</a> can be downloaded to help you organize all of the moving parts of your corporate volunteer event. The template includes a worksheet to help you identify your goals, motivation and audience in the planning and strategy phase. This page can be especially helpful if you still need to get executive buy-in for your event.<br />\nAfter the event strategy tab is a checklist and timeline for the most common steps to planning a volunteer event. We also include a vendor management tab where you can keep track of the vendors you&#8217;re working with, points of contact and cost information. This page also helps you track how much of your budget you&#8217;re using on vendors.<br />\nBecause this template is in Microsoft Excel, it is completely customizable. Feel free to remove steps that aren&#8217;t relevant for your event, add columns and rows for additional things you want to track. This template is your starting point, but was created to be interactive and flexible for your needs.<br />\nWe&#8217;d love to hear how you plan to integrate this template into your organizations corporate volunteering programs.</p>\n","slug":"guide-planning-volunteer-events","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"1485e931-76ac-5475-ac5e-768fc80c87a0"}}}
