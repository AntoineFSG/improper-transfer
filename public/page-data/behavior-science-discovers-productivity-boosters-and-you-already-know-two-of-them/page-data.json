Then there are others&#8217; who seem to exist on a different plane of getting things done.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nFrom the introduction to Smarter Faster Better, a new book by Pulitzer prize-winning <a href=\"http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Habit</a> guru Charles Duhigg, in which he scours the lives of the most productive people he can find to discover their secrets to success.<br />\n<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>His communication is smart and engaging, and, by all accounts, he is gifted at his profession, committed to his customers, supportive of his team, and a devoted husband and father. Whenever you see him in public, he appears relaxed and thoughtful. His accomplishments are important and real.&#8221; </strong></span><br />\nPerhaps this reminds you of someone you know?<br />\nDuhigg wanted to find out how to be like that.<br />\nIn brief, productivity is about making certain choices in certain ways. The way we choose to see ourselves and frame daily decisions; the stories we tell ourselves, and the easy goals we ignore; the sense of community we build among teammates; the creative cultures we establish as leaders: <strong>These are the things that separate the merely busy from the genuinely productive</strong>.<br />\nAt WeSpire we are all about choices, and we&#8217;d add to this list: <span style=\"color: #000080;\">We&#8217;ve found that <em>shared purpose</em> is a key to solid employee engagement.</span> People become passionate and productive at work when they participate, themselves and with colleagues, on meaningful initiatives; supported by top management leaders; whose results they can measure and celebrate together; and when their employer offers a <em>choice</em> of such impactful activities.<br />\nIn the course of researching the book, Duhigg found eight ideas: secrets to being productive in life and business; one of which is the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">power of teams</a>. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work <em>together</em>.<br />\nPsychological safety is a key ingredient to working together:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up. It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A thriving culture of psychological safety is challenging to achieve. Everybody&#8217;s different, and it&#8217;s hard to please everyone all of the time. But we have a couple of tips to recommend:<br />\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>1) Be sure everyone on the team has a voice</strong><strong>&#8216;and uses it! </strong></span><br />\nIf any one person dominates the conversation; or if a few people remain silent during most team meetings, there&#8217;s something off.<br />\nWhat you can do about the <a href=\"http://www.quietrev.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quiet</a> person. Build a relationship 1:1 with that shy person and encourage him to speak up. Tease out his valuable idea, ask if he&#8217;s okay with you mentioning it to others. Yes some people are painfully introverted, but most welcome a friendly shove in the right direction.<br />\nWhat to do if <em>you</em> are that Quiet person. Prepare for meetings. Figure out one idea or datapoint to share with the group. Not sure if it&#8217;s relevant? Run it past a trusted co-worker. Vague re: the meeting topic? Ask the organizer.<br />\nWhat you can do about the Dominant person: Same thing in reverse. Build a relationship with her and ask if she&#8217;s noticed others aren&#8217;t participating. Get her to read chapter 2 of <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-02/book-review-smarter-faster-better-may-make-you-all-of-those-things\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SFB</a>.<br />\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>2) Cultivate high social sensitivity&#8217;be aware when others feel upset or snubbed, and be quick to bring them back into the group.</strong></span><br />\nUse your common sense, remember what your parents taught you, follow the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Golden Rule</a>: whatever motivates you to bring your complete best self to work, channel that. Then use your best self to be aware of how others are doing.<br />\nAnother word for this: compassion.<br />\nIf people are reserved, you might launch a conversation by relating a personal story. Maybe it&#8217;s something not so pretty; maybe you keep it light.<br />\nAt WeSpire, we post a monthly employee <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wespire-employee-spotlight-charlie-ash/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spotlight</a> including a punchy &#8216;Mad Libs&#8217; autobiography that asks <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wespire-employee-spotlight-ellie-perkins-jowers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the subject</a> to complete the sentence People at work would be surprised to know that I ____________________. We all enjoy these <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wespire-employee-spotlight-andrew-borstein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">glimpses</a> into what makes our co-workers tick!<br />\n<strong>Bottom line: at work, at home, we are all always, quite simply, people. So the conditions for psychological safety are things you&#8217;ve known all along. </strong><br />\nThe behaviors that create psychological safety &#8216; conversational turn-taking and empathy &#8216; are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. <em>In fact, they sometimes matter more.</em> ~ Duhigg<br />\n<em>Think about your favorite job ever. Were you part of a team?
