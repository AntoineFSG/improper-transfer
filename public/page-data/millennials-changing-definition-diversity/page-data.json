Their non-millennial colleagues traditionally have believed diversity should be viewed as protection to all, regardless of gender, race, religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Harvard views this as inherent diversity, traits you were born with.<br />\n<strong>Times Are Changing:</strong><br />\nFor generations, employees have been taught to put aside their differences at work, but times have changed. The Millennial generation is the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-113.html\">most diverse generation</a> the U.S. has ever seen, second only to Generation Z, who have not yet entered the workforce. This culturally diverse upbringing has played a big role in making Millennials <a href=\"http://www.instituteforpr.org/millennialswork-perspectives-diversity-inclusion/\">significantly</a> more comfortable talking about diversity and inclusion than older generations.<br />\nMillennials are willing to ask tough questions and are demanding their employers to do the same. In fact, almost half of millennials <a href=\"http://www.instituteforpr.org/millennialswork-perspectives-diversity-inclusion/\">reported</a> not pursuing an employer that doesn&#8217;t maintain or encourage a diverse and inclusive working environment.<br />\nUnfortunately, many organizations are falling victim to the traditional view of diversity, and it&#8217;s starting to cost them big time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Only sixty percent of millennials report being actively engaged when their organization does not foster an inclusive culture, versus eighty-three percent whose organizations do foster an <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3046358/the-new-rules-of-work/millennials-have-a-different-definition-of-diversity-and-inclusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inclusive working environment</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>How Leaders Can Foster Diversity:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Make employees feel heard by providing them with a forum to share their ideas, feedback, and voice.</h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Try not to silo or bucket your employees, each individual has a unique set of skills and passions they bring to the table. Foster connections based on these, not on inherent traits.</h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Look beyond resumes. Individuals with acquired diversity can be invaluable to your organization.</h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Always keep a pulse on your organization&#8217;s culture, make continuous improvements.</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","slug":"millennials-changing-definition-diversity","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"eb7cebb2-52e4-56ac-b62a-6121ba50b4ee"}}}
