We believed that technology&#8217;social networks, game mechanics, mobile, and great content&#8217;could make that journey simpler, faster, and frankly, way more fun.<!--more--><br />\nWe thought the space needed a brand that stood for being smart, practical, helpful and fun, but never preachy.  We also felt that green meant so much more than saving energy and water, but also improving health, adopting innovative solutions like couch surfing and Zipcar, and choosing locally sourced goods.<br />\nI remember a very early conversation with Paul English, the founder of Kayak at a Massachusetts Tech conference.  He loved the idea, with one caveat: you need a shorter name.  For many reasons at the time, both logistical and emotional, Practically Green made sense for us and we went on to build an exciting, effective product and develop a well-known company in the sustainability engagement space.<br />\nHowever, four years ago, I never envisioned that our business would be a rapidly growing enterprise SaaS technology company providing comprehensive action-based employee engagement programs for companies like MGM Resorts, eBay, Unilever and NBCUniversal. That our customer&#8217;s definition of sustainability would have environment at the core, but would also include volunteering, diversity, wellness, citizenship and giving.  That what would make us truly unique is our pioneering use of behavioral science to help people form new habits at work and at home. And that these initiatives would have measurable business results, both in resource costs and overall employee engagement metrics. It increasingly became clear that Practically Green wasn&#8217;t capturing our true impact as well as it could, and thus we are renaming the company to WeSpire.</p>\n<h4><strong>Why WeSpire?</strong></h4>\n<p>Our new name truly captures what was at the core of our mission:  inspiring people to make sustainable choices.  It acknowledges the growing power of the workplace social network to inspire positive actions and create positive impact both at work and at home. It also honors and supports the broader and more impactful definition of sustainability. And yes Paul, it is shorter and easier to spell.<br />\nBut what&#8217;s equally important is what is not changing about the company.  Our brand values continue to be about being smart, practical, helpful and fun. Our<a href=\"/platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> employee engagement platform</a> continues to be highly engaging and provides tangible and measurable business impact to our customers.  We love that our <a href=\"/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">customers</a> see us as true partners in engaging their workforce.  Our <a href=\"/our-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">team</a> and <a href=\"/board-of-directors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">board</a> continue to be one of the best in the business.<br />\nSo join me today in saying hello to WeSpire. We look forward to hearing from you.<br />\nBest,<br />\nSusan Hunt Stevens<br />\nFounder &amp; CEO<br />\nWeSpire</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"/demo\"><em>Request a demo</em></a> <em>to l<a href=\"/demo\"><img class=\"  alignleft wp-image-128\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fp-featured-content-img-300x152.png\" alt=\"demo the WeSpire Employee Engagement Platform\" width=\"182\" height=\"92\" /></a>earn more about how your organization can use WeSpire&#8217;s employee engagement platform to drive measurable, positive impact. </em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"introducing-wespire","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"86fcd754-c17a-5108-9034-c7cecc530035"}}}
