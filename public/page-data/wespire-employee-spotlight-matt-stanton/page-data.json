It&#8217;s internationally renowned, draws on different cultures, it&#8217;s tied to soccer, and obviously is incredible to dance to.<br />\n<strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What do you appreciate most about your childhood?</strong><br />\n<strong>A:</strong> Being a triplet was nice because I always had two other people doing the same thing as me. My siblings gave me two visions to model myself after. It also meant I was never bored and always had playmates!<br />\n<strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Tell us about your favorite teacher/coach/adult figure growing up. Why did they inspire you then, and what have you realized about them now?</strong><br />\n<strong>A:</strong> Freshmen year of college, I had a writing Professor (Nancy Crumbine). She had the biggest influence on how I write today, which in my opinion is the most important thing for your professional life and personal life. She also always had great life advice for us. Her writing motto was &#8220;Show, Don&#8217;t tell!&#8221; and sh&#8217;ed let us know we could do better by scrawling &#8220;SDT&#8221; all over our papers.

Where to?</strong><br />\n<strong>A:</strong> Well I just went trekking in Nepal for two weeks, but I definitely want to practice my Spanish, since I&#8217;ve been on the cusp of being fluent for too long. So I&#8217;d have to say Chile &#8216; mountains to hike, ocean, great food, soccer, and Spanish. I&#8217;d love to get a motorcycle or even a horse and go across the entire country!<br />\n<strong> Q: What&#8217;s the best Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG) you ever heard of, and whose was it? <em>(</em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal\"><em>examples</em></a><em>, for inspiration)</em></strong><br />\n<strong>A:</strong> Read a book by <a href=\"http://atulgawande.com/book/being-mortal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Atul Gahande</a> and he wrote a chapter about the WHO, trying to eradicate polio from India. After lots of effort and many attempts, they finally succeeded. I find it super impressive when a single person who sets out to do something at scale and change a system completely, which means you have to essentially change the way people think completely, and also their most ingrained habits, and that&#8217;s the hardest thing someone can do.<br />\n<strong><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1754\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-06-at-11.21.51-AM-198x300.png\" alt=\"Matt Stanton\" width=\"198\" height=\"300\" />Q:</strong> <strong>What&#8217;s your favorite new vocabulary word?</strong><br />\n<strong>A:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Lit&amp;utm_source=search-action\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lit</a> (Don&#8217;t worry firefighter Matt won&#8217;t let it get to &#8220;lit&#8221;)<br />\n<strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What&#8217;s your favorite meal you made recently?</strong><br />\n<strong>A:</strong> Fish Tacos, heavy on the cilantro and lime.

I love ending a day feeling honestly tired from working hard or accomplishing a goal.<br />\n<strong>Q:</strong> <strong>If you were to die and come back as a person or thing, what do you think it would be?</strong><br />\n<strong>A:</strong> A sea turtle.

There are loads of obstacles and challenges we face both in life and at work &#8211; especially at a start-up, so it&#8217;s nice to have people who can take things lightly and joke about the hard times.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>#ThrowBack MadLib Style:<br />\n<u>Matt Stanton </u>was born in <u>Chicago, IL</u>. He launched his career at WeSpire <u>just over a year ago.</u> His favorite (well his first) manager always encourages him to <u>Never stop learning.&#8221;</u> He joined WeSpire because <u>he believes if you&#8217;re going to spend the majority of your time working you have to make it worthwhile and meaningful, and he wanted to help others unlock meaning for themselves</u>. In his spare time, he likes to <u>DJ, play soccer, and get outside</u>. His colleagues at WeSpire have no idea that he loves <u>pudding, especially the tapioca and rice varieties!</u></p>\n","slug":"wespire-employee-spotlight-matt-stanton","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f9934718-1b04-50c9-b81c-c18df751ab46"}}}
