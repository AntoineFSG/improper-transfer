There are endless reasons for having recognition programs within your organization, but one of the most recent and pressing reasons is that millennials are not only influenced by recognition, they demand it.<br />\nIt&#8217;s important to note we&#8217;re talking about recognition and not rewards. Many times people assume the two go hand in hand and you can&#8217;t have one without the other. It&#8217;s simply not true. You can and should recognize employees for a job well done without writing a check, shipping a gift card or handing over a trophy. While those types of rewards are nice they aren&#8217;t required every time you want to call out a team member for doing a stellar job. Something as simple as an email or making an announcement by ringing the bell, banging the gong, or whatever other signal for celebration you might have in place at your company. In fact, &#8220;Nearly one-third of employees would rather be <a href=\"http://hr.blr.com/HR-news/Compensation/Bonus-Payments/Rewards-recognition-not-all-about-the-money/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recognized</a> for their work accomplishments in a company-wide email from a company executive than receive a bonus of $500 that isn&#8217;t openly publicized by a superior to their coworkers.&#8221;<br />\nHere are 5 recognition ideas you can implement at your organization today:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Living and breathing values:</strong> There&#8217;s a reason you spent so much time laboring over the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/09/your-companys-purpose-is-not-its-vision-mission-or-values/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mission, vision and values</a> of your company. Your values are what&#8217;s important to your company and the best way to make sure you deliver on those values is making your entire team aware of them and practice them each and every day. Call out an employee for completing an act that brings these values to life. It&#8217;s a great way to remind your entire team of what those values are and what it means to live and breathe them in the day to day.</li>\n<li><strong>Above and Beyond:</strong> There are those employees you thought only existed in your dreams. He/she grinds every day from dusk until dawn. They take your game to a whole new level. The things they do surprise even you! Whether it is implementing a project you never thought would get across the finish line, taking the service in customer service to a whole new level, or just being the most reliable member of the team these people need and deserve to be called out.</li>\n<li><strong>Mentor:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/05/17/how-to-become-a-great-mentor/#55f6bf83449e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creating amazing teams and fostering new talent</a> isn&#8217;t a task for everyone. It takes a lot of time, patience and often time means setting aside your own work in order to help someone else do theirs. These folks are literally building the future of your company by cultivating your leaders of tomorrow. Give them a shout out to let them know all of that work that isn&#8217;t formally a part of their job is appreciated.</li>\n<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> There is nothing more exhilarating as a business leader than seeing your team take your business to the next level. Whether it&#8217;s the product manager who thought up a feature that increased your sales by 25% overnight or the marketing manager who dreamt up an innovative campaign that&#8217;s driving buzz about your business in a way you&#8217;ve never seen. New ideas and innovation are critical to the success of any company because they keep your business moving forward and differentiate you from your competition. Highlighting new ideas can get other employees&#8217; thinking outside of the box as well and feeding the innovation engine within your company.</li>\n<li><strong>Customer Delight:</strong> What would your business be without customers? Probably not that much of a business right? How you treat one of the most critical components of your business is what will grow your business for year and years to come. There are people in your company, whether they are down the hall, in the London office, or 10 floors down from you, who are in charge of making your customers not just happy but <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/matt-ehrlichman/the-8-principles-of-customer-delight.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">delighted</a>. Maybe it&#8217;s your customer service rep who went above and beyond to make sure that a customer&#8217;s shipment got there before the big day or maybe it&#8217;s the cashier that made sure <a href=\"https://www.helpscout.net/blog/remarkable-customer-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your elderly customer got to his car safely in the rain</a>. Whatever the story, recognizing these members of your team remind the rest that at the end of the day they are there to serve the customer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>What other things are you recognizing employees for?
