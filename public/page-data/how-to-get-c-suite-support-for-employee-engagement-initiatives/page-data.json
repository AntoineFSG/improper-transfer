If the C-Suite are responsible for cultivating an innovative, productive environment for employees, <strong>why wouldn&#8217;t they be the first to jump on the idea of increasing employee engagement? </strong><!--more--></p>\n<h3><strong>Webinar on building the employee engagement business case</strong></h3>\n<p>This is what we explored during our webinar a few weeks ago, <a href=\"http://info.greenbiz.com/06-10-2014WeSpireWebcast_RecordedLP.html\">How to Get C-Suite Support for Employee Engagement Initiatives</a>. Contributing to the discussion were, Jim Murren (Chairman &amp; CEO of <a href=\"https://www.mgmresorts.com/\">MGM Resorts International</a>), Andy Savitz (author of <a href=\"http://www.getsustainable.net/index.php\"><em>Talent, Transformation and the Triple Bottom Line</em>)</a>, and Susan Hunt Stevens (Founder &amp; CEO of <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/\">WeSpire</a>).</p>\n<h4><strong>Employee Engagement is the right metric</strong></h4>\n<p>Andy started the discussion by sharing the results of his research: measuring employee engagement is the best way to gauge morale and motivation. It is much more valuable than measuring the traditional metric of job satisfaction because it assesses the level of motivation, commitment, and loyalty an employee has for their position and business. When employees have high levels of these three, it&#8217;s like hitting the trifecta for an organization.<br />\n<strong><em>Companies reflecting these metrics have higher profitability, less turnover, fewer work-safety incidents, and, the granddaddy of them all, customer loyalty.</em></strong><br />\nWith the foundation set, Susan talked about the value propositions and metrics to keep in mind when making the employee engagement business case: cost savings, alignment with core values, relevancy to specific needs/urgencies, and impact on attraction and retention of employees.<br />\nJim closed the discussion by stressing the business imperative and why employee engagement programs are not only the right thing to do for employees, but the most profitable. He also discussed his <a href=\"http://blog.wespire.com/culture-eats-strategy-for-lunch\">experience</a> with engaging the 62,000 employees that make up MGM Resorts.</p>\n<h4><strong>3 Keys to Success for C-suite Support for Employee Engagement Programs</strong></h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Give clear &amp; compelling proof for the employee engagement business case.</strong>Use real examples of <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/\">companies that have been successful in employee engagement</a> and <a href=\"/resource/the-state-of-employee-engagement-in-sustainability-csr\">current research</a> on the topic. It&#8217;s easy to build the business case for productivity, talent recruitment &amp; retention, customer satisfaction, and profitability.</li>\n<li><strong> When all else fails, ask. </strong>Ask employees what they like, informally and via surveys. Encourage participation and act on their best ideas. Use real stories to convince top executives that employees genuinely care about the business mission and want sustainability initiatives.</li>\n<li><strong> Know what works in your organization, what is currently valued, and what the pain-points are. </strong>Use this knowledge to guide you in what you need to present to the C-Suite to gain buy-in.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You and the C-Suite have the same goals. Showing them the path to achieve those goals is vital for getting their support.<br />\n<em><a href=\"http://info.greenbiz.com/06-10-2014WeSpireWebcast_RecordedLP.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click here</a> to watch a recording of our webinar How to get C-Suite Support for Employee Engagement Initiatives.</em></p>\n<blockquote><p><em><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\"  wp-image-335 alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire blog image\" width=\"173\" height=\"61\" /></a>Interested in what you read and watched? <a href=\"/blog\">Visit the WeSpire blog and subscribe</a> to keep up to date on trends in action-based employee engagement programs, and the behavioral science behind employee engagement programs that drive measurable, positive impact.</em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"how-to-get-c-suite-support-for-employee-engagement-initiatives","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"ff246f70-9ddd-5c1c-810c-6e5dd1d85a8c"}}}
