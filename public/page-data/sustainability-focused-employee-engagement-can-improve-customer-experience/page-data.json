The study found that employee engagement levels for service employees have decreased over the last few years, while employee engagement levels for all other positions within a company have increased. This is a problem for those businesses invested in customer experience, because employee engagement and customer experience are tightly intertwined, and service employee neglect negatively impacts the customer.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In a <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/16/tech-has-raised-the-bar-on-customer-experience-higher-than-ever-heres-why-you-should-care/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recent interview</a> on VentureBeat, Michael Moritz, chairman of Sequoia Capital stated, For most consumers, customer service is a horrific experience most of the time. All too often, unengaged employees are talking to unhappy customers. Zeynep Ton, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Good-Jobs-Strategy-Companies-ebook/dp/B00DZQE31I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Good Jobs Strategy</a>, calls this low cost, <em>bad jobs</em> approach that many companies take<span class=\"s2\"><em>,</em></span> succeeding at the expense of employees and at the expense of customers.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">If improving the customer experience is a top business priority, the first step is to engage those employees responsible for making customers happy.</p>\n<h4 class=\"p2\">Engaged employees will go the distance</h4>\n<p class=\"p2\">An <a href=\"http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/do-your-b2b-customers-promote-your-business.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article</a> published earlier this year by Bain and Company, states that a B2B company&#8217;s most effective weapon consists of highly engaged employees who go the extra distance to deliver. Engaged employees are more likely to feel ownership to their work, increased motivation to solve customer problems, and a deeper connection to the customer experience they help create.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Of course, better customer experience isn&#8217;t just in the hands of service employees. In a <a href=\"http://www.bain.com/Images/BAIN_BRIEF_The_big_green_talent_machine.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">different report</a><span class=\"s3\">,</span> Bain and Company not only states that engaged employees provide better experiences for customers, but claims they also approach the job with energy&#8217;which enhances productivity&#8217;and come up with creative product, process and service improvements, all of which, serve the customer.</p>\n<h4 class=\"p2\">Measurable returns from employee engagement</h4>\n<p class=\"p2\">And yet, engaging employees doesn&#8217;t just improve your customer experience.

Put simply: Happy employees = Happy customers = Happy shareholders.</p>\n<h4 class=\"p2\">A step forward with sustainability</h4>\n<p class=\"p2\">If you&#8217;re looking for an effective employee engagement strategy to improve customer experience, sustainability-focused programs could be your answer:</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">One of our customers, Caesars Entertainment, recently commissioned Harvard Business School to examine this linkage between employee engagement and customer experience. The <a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=40250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">results</a> showed a strong linkage between high employee participation in their sustainability-focused employee engagement program, Code Rewards, and increased customer loyalty and satisfaction.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">So if you want to improve your customer experience, focus on your employees.
