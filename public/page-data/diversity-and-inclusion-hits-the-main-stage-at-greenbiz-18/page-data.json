The emergence of diversity and inclusion as a topic at a sustainability conference might have surprised a few participants. However, those attendees adjusting their strategies to align with the UN Sustainable Development goals are already familiar with the convergence of topics like climate change, gender equity and poverty alleviation into a broad sustainability framework.<br />\nThe presentation highlighted a barely six month old initiative called <a href=\"https://www.ceoaction.com/\">CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion</a>. What started as an inaugural summit with 70 CEOs now has more than 350 CEOs of the world&#8217;s leading companies and business organizations having signed on. The stated goal is to leverage their individual and collective voices to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace.<br />\nWeSpire started as a sustainability engagement platform for forward-thinking global companies.  Our <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/press-room/wespire-launches-new-wellbeing-and-positive-culture-modules/\">recent launch</a> of a positive workplace module, that includes a number of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, mirrors our customer&#8217;s expanding view of sustainability.  We also see convergence in our customer&#8217;s roles with some former heads of sustainability now overseeing social responsibility more broadly, including diversity and inclusion and they want their programs to be integrated as well.<br />\nWhat this trend reflects is the acknowledgement that if a company achieves the high bar of carbon neutrality, but isn&#8217;t diverse or doesn&#8217;t offer equitable compensation for women, then it&#8217;s hard to really say they are truly sustainable in the broader sense of the word.  True sustainability addresses the full range of environmental, social and governance factors.  For WeSpire, this expansion is very exciting. We are proud that our platform is proving effective in inspiring positive action in ways we could only dream of a few short years ago.  If you find that your role has expanded as well, we&#8217;d love to learn more about how we could help.
