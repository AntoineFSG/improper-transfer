O&#8217;Bryant</a> School of Mathematics &amp; Science.<br />\nThe <a href=\"http://www.bostonpic.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boston PIC</a> works to connect today&#8217;s youth with employment and education opportunities throughout Boston. They partner with organizations all across Boston in the healthcare, biotech, IT, finance and other industries. Most recently they&#8217;ve expanded their partnerships to give high school students a unique look inside Boston&#8217;s innovative and ever-growing startup community.<br />\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\">This is the second year Boston PIC has partnered with startups so we were fascinated to learn more, which is why we invited Josh Bruno, Director of Employer Engagement to our office last Wednesday.</span><br />\nJosh&#8217;s passion for his students and the program were overwhelming. His purpose; help students see their potential and guide them throughout their programs to become more skilled, successful individuals. Josh explained PIC&#8217;s team of career specialists work year round to help students prepare for job shadow day, mock interviews, and summer jobs. PIC offers workshops on resume writing, professional attire, workplace behavior, interview preparation and other skills. Josh explains &#8220;career specialists are the frontline of the organization, getting to know their students, inspiring career exploration and then connecting students to employment opportunities.&#8221; Boston PIC&#8217;s relationship&#8217;s with the Boston community is truly admirable, and the time and thought that goes into placing each student is something to be applauded.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Career specialists are the frontline of the organization, getting to know their students, inspiring career exploration and then connecting students to employment opportunities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Our student, Kiah&#8217;s curiosity fell within engineering; which meant she was lucky enough to shadow our Director of Engineering, Dan Widing and his talented team.<br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1520\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Kiah-and-team-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"Kiah and team\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /><br />\nEach member of our development team took the time to go through their job functions and show Kiah the projects they&#8217;d been working on. Kiah even had the opportunity to help out with some bug fixes! While she spent the majority of the day learning, we all had the pleasure of getting to know Kiah during our all company lunch. She shared with us, her passions and love for technology, ending the day even more excited to learn.<br />\nOur CEO and Founder Susan Hunt Stevens could not have been more thrilled that our female student, was so interested in engineering and technology. Susan knows the importance of filling the large gender gap within technology. Encouraging and empowering more women to get involved and follow their passion and curiosity about technology is critical. Doing so will undoubtedly open an entirely new set of opportunities for women and girls around the world.<br />\nWondering what you could do to get the women and girls in your life to follow their passions and curiosities? <span style=\"color: #000080;\">Susan offers 3 tips of encouragement to help more women get involved:</span><br />\n1. <strong>Get girls involved in technology at a young age.</strong> Encourage your daughters, nieces, or neighbor to sign up for coding programs like <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scratch</a>.<br />\n2. <strong>Embrace the opportunity to be a role model.</strong> Share your tech career with girls and women of all ages . There is no limit to how you could get involved, volunteer during STEM week in a classroom, blog about your experience or speak about your career on a college campus<br />\n3. If you have the opportunity to hire, <strong>be open to people without years of experience</strong> who may bring other outstanding competencies to the role. Since there are fewer women in technology today, that also means there are fewer women with experience but that does not mean they can&#8217;t be just as competent as their male counterparts.<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1521 alignright\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Kiah-and-Dan-300x188.png\" alt=\"Kiah and Dan\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" /><br />\nI think our team is in agreement when we say we need more people, and more specifically women like Kiah in our workplace. We are so happy to have partnered with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BostonPic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PIC</a>. Our team thoroughly enjoyed this experience, and this fantastic program.<br />\n<em>How does your organization get involved in your local community? We&#8217;d love to hear, share with us in the comments. </em></p>\n","slug":"boston-pic-job-shadow-day-at-wespire","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"0d9ee856-1620-56a9-b6ef-5e8ab4530176"}}}
