And I observe the simple principle that as water heats up, it boils.</p>\n<p id=\"0e61\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As we all now <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/hurricanes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/hurricanes.html\">know</a>, elevated water temperatures can cause significant trouble on an oceanic scale.</p>\n<p id=\"83c3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Consider the Caribbean Ocean, and on into the Atlantic Ocean, which lap the shores of lush vacation spots and major urban centers, i.e. Houston, Miami, San Juan, and, further up the coast, New York and Boston. September hurricanes here have shattered records for velocity, frequency, disruption, cost, and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"ec41\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Every day brings more evidence of a changing climate: Arctic sea ice is disappearing rapidly, accelerating sea-level rise. Alaska permafrost is thawing, spewing dangerous methane into an overloaded atmosphere. Conditions are ideal for <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2017/pacific-crest-trail-lit-up-by-wildfires\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2017/pacific-crest-trail-lit-up-by-wildfires\">wildfires in the West</a>. Conditions are ideal for all of it.</p>\n<p id=\"199e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Americans are awakening to the reality that our political leaders in control are exacerbating climate calamity instead of protecting an increasingly aware population from these extremes.</p>\n<p id=\"dfe0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">In the United States, we have in place a range of policies that all but guarantees a worsening string of Katrinas, Sandys, Harveys and Irmas and, now, Marias as far as we can see into the future,well-known hurricane specialist Kerry Emanuel <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/09/19/why-its-time-to-stop-calling-these-hurricane-disasters-natural\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" data-href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/09/19/why-its-time-to-stop-calling-these-hurricane-disasters-natural\">writes in the Washington Post</a>. Climate change acts as a threat-multiplier to these policy-generated disasters, making them progressively worse than they would have been in a stable climate.</p>\n<p id=\"b746\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Last night at a South-End dinner party among new acquaintances, the conversation turned from the delicious food to clean-tech investments and climate-policy issues and then to the anatomical manifestations of a new classification of stress.</p>\n<p id=\"1105\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;I must have rock marbles in my shoulders,&#8221; said one foundation executive, wincing and shifting in her seat. Across the table, an interior designer nodded vigorously. &#8220;I have TMJ. Otherwise known as clenching your teeth,&#8221; she explained to the group.</p>\n<p id=\"d67b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;Are you a clencher or are you a grinder?&#8221; the foundation executive inquired.</p>\n<p id=\"9509\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;Clencher. My doctor gave me a mouthguard to wear when I sleep. It wasn&#8217;t cheap, and it doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221; In a low voice, an insurance banker mentioned his worsening neck spasms.</p>\n<p id=\"1dc3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">We all want to know when the next storm will hit.</strong></p>\n<p id=\"7ded\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One psychologist says that hurricane Irma was &#8220;one of the most anxiety-inducing storms&#8221; in memory before, during, and after the storm hit mainland Florida. The images and the length of time it took to get here made it even worse. In waiting for the storm, you are talking about the fear of the future and when it&#8217;s over, you are talking about the fear of what you are returning to, if anything. Floridians raced to board up their houses, sandbag the garage, pack their cars, and bundle up their kids and pets for evacuation, only to revise those plans with each storm-tracker update. Since Irma was the size of France, it easily covered the entire peninsula.</p>\n<p id=\"1eda\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">&#8220;People are worn down by the process of awaiting a storm, the process of fighting gas lines, the process of evacuating, staying with friends or family.&#8221; This from a New York Times report titled &#8220;Frazzled Floridians in Search of a Balm&#8221; posted on September 14.</p>\n<figure id=\"3659\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"0*XAEli5OpAxWzSATl.\" data-width=\"820\" data-height=\"546\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*XAEli5OpAxWzSATl.\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XAEli5OpAxWzSATl.\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XAEli5OpAxWzSATl.\" /></div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Ricardo Arduengo/Agence France-Presse.

The big picture is coming into focus for tens of millions:<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> This is what climate change looks like</strong>.</p>\n<p id=\"3c7b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And, we want to be part of the solution.</p>\n<h4 id=\"a0bb\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">First, I have a humble suggestion:</strong></h4>\n<p id=\"b492\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Do nothing.</strong></p>\n<p id=\"98fa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">For ten minutes.</strong></p>\n<p id=\"b4ff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Every day.</strong></p>\n<p id=\"f1e7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Sitting quietly, aka meditating, is one of the best things you can do for your overall health and sanity. It&#8217;s free, it doesn&#8217;t take much time, it will help you think more clearly, and you will do everything better.</p>\n<p id=\"42a4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Concentrate on your breath. You know, breath: the air that goes in and out of you, which keeps you alive allday/allnight without you paying much attention. For ten minutes, pay attention: Breathe. Count one as you inhale, two as you exhale. Try counting to eight. Inhale, exhale, 5, 6, 7, 8. Then try sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"f1e9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You&#8217;re still sitting there, right?</p>\n<p id=\"fee0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Easy? No. It is not. You&#8217;ll fidget, you&#8217;ll get side-tracked, you&#8217;ll think about what&#8217;s for dinner. That&#8217;s completely to be expected. Never mind. The point is to set those things aside, again and again. And again.</p>\n<p id=\"4f64\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Return to the simple task at hand: do nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"3b0a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Fortunately there&#8217;s an app for this! I live by Headspace, Andy Puddicomb&#8217;s brilliant meditation university on a phone. Imagine a world where we can all choose our own surnames! “Puddicomba” is perfect for this savvy, soothing, mindfulness expert equal parts friendly cockney bloke-at-a-pub and enlightened spiritual leader on high. Like all successful on-screen edutainers, Andy can become a dear friend. In truth, he can become essential.</p>\n<p id=\"0786\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At last count, more than 6 million people around the world are Headspacers. Try it free:<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">https://www.headspace.com/</a></p>\n<p id=\"5834\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And, or, find yourself a great yoga class. They&#8217;re all around.</p>\n<p id=\"5f11\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you pay attention in this way, you are building an insistence on being your best so you can do your best work in the world. Returning to the simple exercise of stillness and breathing, you learn to do one thing well, one at a time. And that, my friends, is the path to accomplishment.</p>\n<p id=\"d271\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Image @NASA</p>\n<p id=\"f336\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"ttps://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/maria-atlantic-ocean\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/maria-atlantic-ocean\">NASA Satellite Images</a></p>\n<section class=\"section section--body section--last\">\n<div class=\"section-divider\">***</div>\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Sarah Finnie Robinson is a Founding Partner at WeSpire.
