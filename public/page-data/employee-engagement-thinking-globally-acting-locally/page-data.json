This conversation sparked what might be one of my favorite examples of the power of local &#8216; particularly when thinking about employee engagement.<br />\nTimberland operates a factory in the Dominican Republic and uses an Ambassador model, called <a href=\"https://www.timberland.com/responsibility/stories/global-stewards-scale-csr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Global Stewards program,</a> to engage local employees in their social impact work.  Like all Ambassadors, the team wants to make sure that employees knew what the company was doing related to sustainability and CSR at the company.  However, as in most companies, getting employees attention was proving to be a struggle.<br />\nBut did they put up signs?  Send emails?  Hold a fair and see what happens?  No, these creative employees asked two absolutely critical questions to engagement.  First, where do we have a captive, but receptive audience during the work day?  Two, how do we make them care about what we have to say?<br />\nThe answer for Timberland&#8217;s employees in the factory in the Dominican Republic:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Employees generally ride a bus into the factory every morning or night. So the Ambassadors began using the bus rides to share information about what was happening.  This is a genius idea that can be replicated in so many different ways.  Conference attendees from other companies talked about sharing at stand-ups, tailgate meetings, shift briefings, and break rooms.</li>\n<li>Timberland Ambassadors in the DR put together a contest for teams to write and perform Merengue songs about their CSR initiatives.  They held a battle of the bands and the winning song was recorded and played over the PA system while the employees worked in the factory.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is likely no way that a central corporate team would have ever come up with those ideas.  As McIlwraith stated, By infusing local knowledge and leadership into the effort and initiatives, we were able to engage employees at a deeper and more memorable level.<br />\nAt WeSpire, we&#8217;ve learned how critical it is to encourage our customers to act local by bringing in local program owners to access the platform and think through how to design and run targeted programs based on role, geography or interests.</p>\n<h3><em>What tactics do you use to engage your employees at a local level?</em></h3>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-thinking-globally-acting-locally","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"0bd33ffe-0de9-5711-89ba-b05add326d10"}}}
