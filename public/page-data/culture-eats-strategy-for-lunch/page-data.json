His point: creating a company culture that reflects your company values, rewards innovation, and empowers employees will do more for driving business results than any strategy plan.<!--more--><br />\nJim went on to say that although MGM has a code of conduct that every employee signs each year, the employees are not referring back to that document with the hundreds of decisions that they make every day.</p>\n<h3><strong>What really drives employee behavior is the company culture.</strong></h3>\n<p>Studies show that employees who are happy produce better results. <strong>Companies with happy employees outperform the competition by 20%</strong> (Source: <a href=\"http://www.marketinginnovators.com/public/uploads/2011/09/TheEffects.pdf\">Marketing Innovation</a>). So, if you want to change employee behavior, you have to change the company culture. It&#8217;s easy to say, but not easily done.<br />\nAn inefficiency that Jim identified shortly after his arrival at MGM was the company&#8217;s overreliance on one-way communication with employees in the form of email blasts, town-hall meetings, and posters. Employees were not consistently engaging with the opportunities that were being handed down to them. Jim found that employees were more likely to engage with an initiative when it was part of a two-way competition.</p>\n<h4><strong>Inclusiveness drives engagement and performance</strong></h4>\n<p>Here are a few takeaways from Jim&#8217;s comments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In order to understand what the company culture truly is, and how to change it, it is most effective to engage all parties involved. Otherwise, organizations run the risk of the company culture being one where the execs prescribe and the staff ignores&#8217;a recipe for an unengaged workforce. By having a company-wide conversation, the internal initiatives are increasingly well guided, and therefore, more readily adopted.</li>\n<li>By creating an inclusive environment, you are already changing the culture. When employees engage in internal decisions, they get a taste of partial-ownership over the company. That is to say, <strong>rather than just working for the company they can actually shape the company</strong>. By empowering employees in this way, they are more likely to go above and beyond their baseline duties.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><strong>Employee engagement in practice</strong></h4>\n<p>The forum for communication with employees will vary based on size and structure of a company. MGM Resorts has 62,000 employees with 23 different resorts. For Jim, their sustainability and CSR program, MY Green Advantage, is one successful tool for having conversation-based communication across their entire employee base, and tracking its impact. This program, developed in partnership with <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/\">WeSpire</a>, takes an action-based approach to employee engagement by allowing users to spread the word about the positive impact that are making within the organization and at home.<br />\nCulture eats strategy for lunch. In other words, align the desired behavior change with the company culture and values of your company. Otherwise, your employees won&#8217;t bite.<br />\n<em>To learn more about MGM&#8217;s employee engagement programs, watch the webinar <a href=\"http://info.greenbiz.com/06-10-2014WeSpireWebcast_RecordedLP.html\">How to Get C-Suite Support for Employee Engagement Initiatives</a>.
