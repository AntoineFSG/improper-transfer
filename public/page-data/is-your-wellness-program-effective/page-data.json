In fact, more than <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2015/07/08/more-than-two-thirds-of-u-s-employers-currently-offer-wellness-programs-study-says/#7d0fca916c7b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">70 percent</a> of U.S. employers offer a general wellness program. However, of the 3.2 billion workers in the world, <strong>over half</strong> still consider themselves unwell.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nThe missing link is that most employers&#8217; wellness programs fail to take a holistic approach to employee wellness, putting all of their focus on physical wellbeing, and forgetting about what else makes their employees healthy, happy and engaged.<br />\nAs the line between work and life continues to get fuzzier, employees expect their employers to do more for their overall wellness, but what exactly does that entail?<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Global-Wellness-Graphic.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1703 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Global-Wellness-Graphic-213x300.png\" alt=\"Global Wellness Graphic\" width=\"213\" height=\"300\" /></a><br />\nHere are three issues employees around the world face and how your wellness programming can address them.<br />\n<strong>1. A Lack of Purpose</strong><br />\nThe Global Wellness institute found that 24% of employees are actively disengaged in their work, and <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/181289/majority-employees-not-engaged-despite-gains-2014.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gallup&#8217;s</a> most recent report shows that these numbers are still climbing. One of the most powerful ways to combat this alarming statistic is by connecting your employees to your organization&#8217;s larger purpose.<br />\nHaving a company <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3048197/hit-the-ground-running/why-purpose-driven-companies-are-often-more-successful\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">purpose</a> activates employees in a way that pursing profits never will. Make it clear to your employees how their role makes an impact, be genuine, and hire people who align with your organizations mission.<br />\n<strong>2. Financial Insecurity</strong><br />\nWith 74% of the working population living off of $13 or less a day, it&#8217;s no wonder that employees are feeling over worked and stressed.<br />\nYour company has put a lot of time, money and resources into its benefits plans, and unfortunately a majority of employees aren&#8217;t even aware of what&#8217;s available to them. Whether it be health care and dental insurance, retirement saving options, discounted gym memberships, transportation support, deals on travel or professional development opportunities, make them known and accessible.<br />\n<strong>3. Personal Health Issues</strong><br />\nAs human life expectancy increases, people are retiring later, resulting in 18 percent of the working population being over 55. Although this generation brings years of experience and expertise with them, they also have higher health care costs. Even more distressing when it comes to employee health, <strong>52 percent</strong> of all employees are reported to be overweight or obese. It&#8217;s time to take employee health seriously.<br />\nShow your employees you support their physical wellbeing by making it easy to make healthy decisions. Partner with a local gym to provide classes or discounted memberships, provide healthier meal options, suggest walking meetings or offer companywide team sports. Empower your employees to take charge of their health and give them resources to do so. It&#8217;s also an effective strategy to lowering your companies <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/employee-engagement-program-idea-from-our-office-to-yours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">health care expenses</a><br />\nThese simple improvements can go a long way in creating an environment of healthy, happy, and engaged employees.<br />\n<em>What does wellness look like at your company?</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n","slug":"is-your-wellness-program-effective","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"bb4b815f-cd35-5b8f-ac82-a566ab72c0ed"}}}
