It can also work to hone and expand skill sets in the areas of leadership, work-life balance and knowledge-sharing.  Moreover, customers will come to understand the unique and thoughtful ways a brand strives to give back when in ways that generate significant and real impact.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;It&#8217;s no secret that volunteering is appealing to Millennials according to the Millennial Impact Report which found that 97% of Millennials in the study preferred using their individual skills to help a cause, and a company&#8217;s involvement with causes is the third most important factor to Millennials when applying for a job. Fifty-five percent were influenced to take a job after cause work was discussed in their job interviews, and of those, 55% had volunteered 10-20 hours in the previous month.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Essential Steps to Build Your Corporate Volunteering Program</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Define a Corporate Mission, Vision &amp; Values</strong>: establish a clear path for your company and the targeted impact like Unilever which set out an ambitious vision to double its size while reducing its overall environmental footprint and increasing its positive social impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Identify Causes that Align with Corporate Branding, Goals and Unique Employee Skills</strong>: look for volunteering opportunities that allows employees to explore skills that aren&#8217;t a part of their day job and also promotes the collective impact a company can make based on a specialized expertise; it&#8217;s important to align the expertise to the cause so that it&#8217;s mutually beneficial.</li>\n<li><strong>Identify Goals for Positive Impact</strong>: as with any engagement program, clear measures of success will ensure ROI; a roadmap that includes duration, specific actions, methods of recognition, marketing plan and specific and realistic goals that you would like to accomplish by the end of each initiative.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrate with Other Employee Engagement Programs</strong>: volunteering alone is great but when it&#8217;s coupled with other socially responsible and sustainable programs, it becomes every more inspiring for employees to create personals and collective impact via the company; we&#8217;ve found that when programs are combined, it can exponentially increase the engagement rate by 10% (based on a random 30 day window of user activity on the platform).</li>\n<li><strong>Choose the Right Platform</strong>: corporate volunteer program success doesn&#8217;t come without the right platform to avoid the slow, manual and costly processes to design, implement, track and measure the impact of your program; a comprehensive platform delivers content in the way of actions that employees can take relative to their interested and share with others based on their preferences for collaboration.</li>\n<li><strong>Measure the Impact</strong>: gaining insight into the motivations of your employees and how they drive others to participate is critical to the long term success of your program; a platform that can deliver this in real time is even more powerful; analyze the collective impact will help you improve the effectiveness of future employee volunteer programs.</li>\n<li><strong>Lather, Rinse &amp; Repeat</strong>: the most lucrative programs are those that continually evolve based on intelligence mined from engagement practices (both good and not so good); tools that allow you to monitor user activity (or lack thereof) will create the narrative you need to develop that will inform your future endeavors.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The End Game</h3>\n<p>Empowering your employees to contribute to the common good, will pay huge dividends both within and outside of your organization. A platform that can deliver recommended actions that appeal to your employees will exponentially increase the likelihood of participation. This activity will spur greater awareness to the rest of the organization so that you create a wider audience who cares about your causes and encourages others to share their experiences creating impact (photos, telling their stories, recognizing and inspiring others).<br />\nThe best engagement programs create an online community that transcends the typical organizational divides with the cultivation of an organic groundswell of activity from the ground up. The best and most rewarding results comes with the greater sense of personal and professional purpose employees gain when they&#8217;re active in your volunteer program which becomes the fuel that will sustain and broaden your ongoing corporate initiatives.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-383\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/volunteering-double-150x150.png\" alt=\"corporate volunteer programs\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />View WeSpire&#8217;s <a title=\"Volunteering\" href=\"http://www.wespire.com/volunteering-employee-engagement-program/\">volunteering behavioral project library</a> to learn more about using behavioral<br />\ntechnology to improve employee engagement.</em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"corporate-volunteer-programs-leveraging-workplace-skills-for-good","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"799dd76d-a8ca-51c2-8280-ccbc4b0ab98e"}}}
