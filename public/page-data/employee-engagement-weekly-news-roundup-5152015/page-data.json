However, on a concept level, it includes the idea of reciprocity; what you put into the employee experience, you get out in the return of productivity, performance, loyalty, etc. Despite many failed efforts, in the aggregate, measured employee engagement has not increased meaningfully. The author argues that in order to save engagement (and their workforce), businesses need to lay everything out on the table and be transparent and start with improving conversations between managers and employees.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/-the-importance-of-a-good-human-resources-department/392969/\">To Do Good in the World, Get a Better HR Department</a></h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that HR departments sometimes fall victim to the brunt of jokes in corporate America, however, as the author puts it, But for companies that are trying to change&#8217;whether to become better corporate citizens or simply more successful&#8217;a smart and flexible HR department is crucial. The author suggests that in order for companies to stay relevant they should steer away from traditional employee engagement (team-building excursions, gamerooms, beer-cart Fridays) and channel the company&#8217;s talent and resources to help both its bottom line and society at large. Some best practices can be found in companies like Lear, Eileen Fisher, and Google.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2015/05/12/employee-recognition-cost-free-to-provide-costly-to-neglect/2/\">Employee Recognition: Cost-Free To Provide, Costly To Neglect<br />\n</a></h3>\n<p>Research shows the increasing value and importance of recognition at work, and data suggests that Millennial employees especially expect and enjoy recognition. The author points out the irony that although the Recognition Gap&#8217; is glaring and needs to be addressed, it is also easily avoidable. To make an employee feel valued and appreciated, it likely doesn&#8217;t require fancy programs&#8217;often, <strong>the most treasured and desired recognition is simple, sincere appreciation sincerely expressed</strong>. In order to nail the point home, reflect on what makes you feel valued in your own position. How can you provide that experience for all of your employees?</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/blog/dimitar_vlahov/10_critical_corporate_sustainability_trends_watch_2015_beyond\">10 Critical Corporate Sustainability Trends to Watch in 2015 and Beyond</a></h3>\n<p>The Sustainable Brands community is vast and boasts members who lead the world of business in the most innovative and successful sustainability initiatives.

Great managers create enthusiastic, energized teams that build highly successful organizations and engage customers. Companies that hire managers based on talent have 48% higher profitability, 22% higher productivity, 30% higher employee engagement scores, 17% higher customer engagement scores, and 19% lower turnover. New research from Gallup suggests gender might have something to do with it: female managers are more likely to be engaged in their work. In this article, Gallup offers 4 pieces of advice on how companies can hire and develop more great managers.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\"  wp-image-335 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire blog image\" width=\"175\" height=\"62\" /></a>Visit the <a href=\"/blog\">WeSpire blog</a> and subscribe to get the latest employee engagement articles delivered straight into your inbox.</p></blockquote>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-weekly-news-roundup-5152015","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"57dc623d-c58c-59ab-9f01-daa4529ec25f"}}}
