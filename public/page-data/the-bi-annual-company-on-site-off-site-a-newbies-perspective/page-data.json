In a cushy corporate conference room, the whole team fit around a large table. Welcome to our bi-annual company on-site/off-site, a chance for us to review our performance so far in 2014, share rest-of-year plans&#8217; and have a little bit of fun. For a new intern such as myself, I wasn&#8217;t sure what it would mean, but I was excited.<!--more--></p>\n<h4><strong>This was my chance to see WeSpire walk the talk on building employee engagement.</strong></h4>\n<p>The purpose of our first stop of the day was to increase transparency on company strategies and results while also encouraging team-building, cross-department knowledge sharing, and ideation. We talked about WeSpire&#8217;s <a href=\"/wespire-releases-the-state-of-employee-engagement-in-sustainability-and-csr\">accomplishments</a>, the challenges facing the company, and plans to overcome these obstacles. As team members contributed their various data, insights, and opinions, the company&#8217;s mission and values became very clear to me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The company mosaic was being revealed, and what&#8217;s more, I could see that my role this summer was an important piece. With this knowledge, all I needed was a helmet and some shoulder pads. I was ready to run through a brick wall for WeSpire.</p></blockquote>\n<h4><strong>Leaving time for some fun</strong></h4>\n<p>When the formal meeting ended, we hustled down to the bus stop (yeah for public transportation!) for our ride over to <a href=\"http://www.hopsters.net/\">Hopsters</a>, a local restaurant where you can make your own craft beer. We were excited to learn that the restaurant sources its ingredients for both the food and the beer from a local farm and sends its used grains back to the farm to be used as pig feed. They call this a farm-to-table-and-back-to-farm kind of place. This creative commitment to sustainable local agriculture was inspiring, and delicious! It was even more fun knowing the beer we made would be going back to WeSpire HQ. Now that&#8217;s truly a local brew.<br />\nWhile watching the U.S. soccer team lose a heartbreaker to Belgium, we ate, drank (cranberry juice in my case), and joked for a couple hours.  It was a more social, fun continuation of the earlier conversations. It gave me the opportunity to get to know my new teammates better, and hear their informal thoughts and perspectives on the company&#8217;s next six months.</p>\n<h4><strong>Employee engagement makes a difference</strong></h4>\n<p>Reflecting on the day&#8217;s excitement, I understood that WeSpire truly practices what it preaches when it comes to building employee engagement. These bi-annual on-site, off-site events engage every employee (even interns!) in the company&#8217;s mission by transparently providing progress reports and encouraging collaborative goal-setting. Fun afternoons outside of the office foster important team-building and shape the company culture. Going to local-oriented restaurants like Hopsters, furthermore, reinforces WeSpire&#8217;s passion for sustainability.<br />\nEvery day I come to work at WeSpire, it&#8217;s busy, busy, busy. Still, WeSpire took an entire day to pause and evaluate its progress. I think this demonstrates WeSpire&#8217;s <a href=\"/our-story\">commitment</a> to being a mission-based, goal-oriented company, keeping employees aligned and engaged as the company continues to grow and flourish. My time at WeSpire has been short so far, but events like the on-site/off-site have already made me feel like an integral part of this young and growing company.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-335 size-medium\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire blog about building employee engagement\" width=\"300\" height=\"106\" /></a>Like what you read? <a title=\"Blog\" href=\"/blog\">Visit and subscribe to our blog</a> to keep up to date with employee engagement programs that can help drive measurable, positive impact at your organization.  </em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"the-bi-annual-company-on-site-off-site-a-newbies-perspective","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"d152fbe7-991d-5208-b170-cfd9be364912"}}}
