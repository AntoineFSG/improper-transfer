Yet at the same time, engaging women and girls is pivotal to addressing global warming successfully. Or did you know that the power sector currently accounts for around 40% of annual greenhouse gas emissions, making it the highest-emitting sector? By advocating for solutions in the energy sector we can have significant impacts on both the climate and financial bottom line. <br /></p>\n\n\n<p>When WeSpire came across these messages (and many more!) in EcoChallenge’s library of sustainability-focused educational campaigns, we knew we had to share the wealth of inspiration they offer. <a href=\"https://ecochallenge.org/\">EcoChallenge.org</a> puts together special sustainability-focused campaigns that engage tens of thousands of students, coworkers, and community members from across the globe. WeSpire is sharing a few of their campaigns with our corporate clients so they can also engage their employees in these simple, fun, and impactful sustainability campaigns.<br /></p>\n\n\n<p>This year, EcoChallege’s campaigns highlight the 100 most substantive solutions to global warming according to <a href=\"https://drawdown.ecochallenge.org/\">Project Drawdown</a>. From watching fun videos on how Methane Digesters can reduce energy emissions, to tracking food waste or supporting women-owned businesses, employees can learn about practical solutions to climate change, take action, and contribute to a world of collective impact! Check out our shared campaigns and inspire your employees to find ways to promote healthier people, healthier communities, and a healthier world. &nbsp;<br /></p>\n","slug":"earth-day-ecochallenge","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"152a2779-d1a0-50d4-887c-42c607838d04"}}}
