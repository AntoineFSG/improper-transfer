One of the employees in the office is running a corporate volunteer program at a local soup kitchen in two weeks, and is looking for other volunteers to help out. Four people sign up to volunteer. They meet up, go to the soup kitchen, and return to the office. Due to the low turnout, they never publicize their action, and nobody else finds out about it. The employee who planned the program is discouraged about the level of volunteer engagement in the organization, and begins looking around at other companies that may be a better fit with her personal values.<!--more--><br />\nSounds familiar? <strong>The average Fortune 500 company is only 26% compliant with drivers of successful corporate volunteering programs</strong> (Source: <a href=\"http://www.handsonnetwork.org/resources/download/5351\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boston College</a>).</p>\n<h3>Turn your corporate volunteering programs into an HR tool.</h3>\n<p>Corporate volunteerism has been linked to increased job satisfaction, employee engagement and retention rates, and improved brand reputation. Consequently, many companies such as <a href=\"http://www.demos.org/\">Demos</a> have hailed these programs a triple win, as not just the communities, but the participating employees and companies also reap the benefits of corporate volunteerism. So how come so many corporate volunteering programs never succeed as expected? Here are a few tips that will help you avoid the volunteering breakdown:</p>\n<h4><strong>Get buy-in from corporate leadership</strong></h4>\n<p>Even if your company executives have already allocated a budget for corporate volunteering programs, don&#8217;t let them pass off all of the responsibility for executing the program to you. The leadership has so much more to offer, but it is your responsibility to make sure they <a href=\"http://www.causecast.com/blog/5-ways-to-get-leadership-engaged-in-your-employee-volunteer-programs/\">remain engaged with your program</a>. Think about the message that your CEO will be sending by volunteering side by side with your employees or by personally sending out emails emphasizing the successes of the program.</p>\n<h4><strong>Find out what employees want</strong></h4>\n<p>Every employee has a different reason for wanting to participate in your employee volunteer program, and it <a href=\"http://www.hrotoday.com/content/5078/motivation-detective\">might not be obvious</a>. For many, this is an opportunity to hone a range of soft and hard skills that will help them excel in the workplace. At <a href=\"http://www.barclays.com/\">Barclays Bank</a>, two-thirds of employees saw a <a href=\"http://www.pointsoflight.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/measuring_employee_volunteer_programs.pdf\">noticeable improvement</a> in their communication skills, while 45% saw improvements in their negotiating, 43% in teamworking, and 41% in leadership skills. Other employees may have personal connections with specific non-profits, or just feel good making a difference.</p>\n<h4><strong>Set aside time to volunteer</strong></h4>\n<p>Whether you allocate a few days per employee per year or <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3027465/dialed/why-every-company-should-pay-employees-to-volunteer\">offer a month of paid leave</a>, make sure that employees are given time out of their work day, rather than out of their personal lives, to volunteer. Make it clear to managers that employees should be encouraged to volunteer, not penalized for it. Employees should not need to choose between staying at their desks to answer their managers&#8217; emails and attending a corporate volunteering event that they had signed up for.</p>\n<h4><strong>Leverage the power of collective action</strong></h4>\n<p>This past year, we have seen the power of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/causeintegration/2014/10/15/philanthropy-2-0-ice-buckets-mustaches-and-sniffing-strangers/\">viral activism</a> &#8216; the <a href=\"http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ice-bucket-challenge.html\">ALS ice bucket challenge</a>, <a href=\"http://us.movember.com/\">Movember</a>, and others. Corporate volunteering programs could benefit greatly by leveraging the behavioral science behind these movements. Implement technology, such as <a href=\"/platform\">WeSpire&#8217;s employee engagement platform</a>, so that employees can share what they have done and encourage others to take the time to volunteer. Although each employee&#8217;s positive action may only make a small difference, the collective whole of your organization will make a giant impact if your employees are engaged.</p>\n<h4><strong>Measure your impact</strong></h4>\n<p>Make the power of your employees&#8217; collective action clear to them by tracking the impact of your volunteering program. Some companies, <a href=\"http://www.pointsoflight.org/sites/default/files/corporate-institute/ubm_b4b_whitepaper8.pdf\">such as HP</a>, measure the impact of their programs by monetizing the social benefits that they are providing, while others may just report the number of employee hours that are contributed. Regardless of how you choose to measure your program, the impact data will empower employees to continue taking <a href=\"/the-power-of-incentives-and-collective-action\">positive actions</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><br />\n<a href=\"/platform\"><img class=\"  alignleft wp-image-285\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/volunteering-copy-300x300.png\" alt=\"Employee engagement platform for corporate volunteering programs\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a>Check out <a href=\"/platform\">WeSpire&#8217;s platform page</a> to learn more about partnering with WeSpire for your corporate volunteering programs.<br />\n</em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"the-right-way-to-manage-your-corporate-volunteering-programs","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"6b0bbbdc-a399-5cd5-8673-ba2b34a97d94"}}}
