At WeSpire we are extremely fortunate to have a number of amazing colleagues, all working to bring purpose to employees at companies large and small around the world.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nEvery month we shine the spotlight on one member of the WeSpire team, giving you an <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wespire-employee-spotlight-andrew-borstein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ongoing glimpse</a> into the workforce behind the most powerful employee-engagement platform on the market today.<br />\n<strong>Please say Hello to Ellie Perkins Jowers, WeSpire Sales Executive!</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ELLIE-WEDDING.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1435 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ELLIE-WEDDING.jpg\" alt=\"ELLIE\" width=\"512\" height=\"341\" /></a><br />\nQ: What are the top five most-used apps on your phone?<br />\n<strong>A: Spotify, Instagram, Hopper, WhatsApp, <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Candy Crush</span></strong><br />\nQ: What do you appreciate most about your childhood?<br />\n<strong>A: Spending the first few years of my life in Maine in a house off the grid that my parents built. I think it instilled a fundamental appreciation for living sustainably, well before it was cool to do so. I&#8217;m also very appreciative of having had a crew of chickens and goats for pets, who I used to read to every day after school. </strong><br />\nQ: Tell us about your favorite teacher/coach/adult figure growing up. Why did they inspire you then, and what have you realized about them now?<br />\n<strong>A: My mother. She always challenged me to reach for my dreams, no matter how big, and told me I could do anything, be anything. She also always told me to trust the process. It&#8217;s taken me a long time to learn to do that (I&#8217;m still learning!), and as I&#8217;ve gotten older, I&#8217;ve realized just how right she was. Trusting the process remains the most valuable piece of advice I ever received, and something I practice daily. </strong><br />\nQ: You have to go on vacation for two weeks, all expenses paid. Where to?<br />\n<strong>A: Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa &#8216; I&#8217;ve always wanted to go to the Okavango Delta on a safari adventure. There is an open-air tree house I recently discovered that is in the middle of a game preserve in South Africa, where you can spend the night under the stars and safely above the wild animals roaming beneath. Sounds like a little slice of heaven.</strong><br />\nQ: If you were in charge, what would you fix?<br />\n<strong>A: The fact that climate change is still contested. </strong><br />\n<strong> </strong>Q: What&#8217;s the best Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG) you ever heard of, and whose was it? <em>(</em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>examples</em></a><em>, for inspiration) </em><br />\n<strong>A: SpaceX&#8217;s goal of enabling human exploration and settlement of Mars</strong><strong>. That&#8217;s pretty BHAG!</strong><br />\nQ: When you&#8217;re at work, what&#8217;s the most interesting opportunity you have to solve a Big Hairy Audacious Problem (BHAP)?<br />\n<strong>A: To turn the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/188033/worldwide-employee-engagement-crisis.aspx?g_source=EMPLOYEE%20ENGAGEMENT&amp;g_medium=search&amp;g_campaign=tiles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">13<em>%</em> of employees</a> around the world who are engaged at work to <em>100%</em>. We are on the road toward solving that problem by connecting employees to meaning and purpose at work. It&#8217;s fascinating, crazy hard, and exhilarating all at once &#8216; but I think we can do it.</strong><br />\n<em> </em>Q: If you could hire a personal assistant tomorrow, what three questions would you ask him/or her in the job interview?<br />\n<strong>A: Why are you interested in this job? Are you passionate about making this world a more sustainable and just place? Do you drink wine? (The correct answer is yes.)</strong><br />\nQ: What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?<br />\n<strong>A: I would say anything about seriously hurting someone else is bad form. Other then that, I pretty much joke about everything. I&#8217;m known for my fabulous(ly bad) 4<sup>th</sup> grade sense of humor. </strong><br />\nQ: What&#8217;s your favorite new vocabulary word?<br />\n<strong>A: Well it&#8217;s not a new word <em>per se</em>, but &#8220;purpose&#8221; has become my new favorite word, and I mean it in the way <a href=\"http://purposeeconomy.com/author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aaron Hurst</a> has defined it, relating to the purpose economy. I think Carol Cone <a href=\"http://www.triplepundit.com/2016/01/key-purpose-developments-will-influence-business-2016/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recently summed it up</a> best: Purpose has eclipsed CSR, sustainability, and other definitions, because&#8217; it integrates the entire enterprise, powering it boldly from the inside out.</strong><br />\nQ: What&#8217;s your favorite meal you made recently?<br />\n<strong>A: My mother&#8217;s famous beef and vegetable stew. It&#8217;s the easiest and best thing to make. I just throw vegetables, stew beef, spices and herbs into the crock pot in the morning, and <em>voila!</em> I come home in the evening to aromas of my childhood, cold winter nights in Maine, and all things delicious.</strong><br />\nQ: Signature cocktail?<br />\n<strong>A: </strong><a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/recipes/a3747/dark-and-stormy-drink-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Dark &amp; Stormy</strong></a><strong>! Or a big, bold glass of red.</strong><br />\nQ: Greatest extravagance?<br />\n<strong>A: Traveling to far-off places. My husband and I try to do one big adventure a year to a country we&#8217;ve never been.</strong><br />\n<em>(Editors&#8217; note: we noticed! Morocco, London, and we hear Thailand is coming up soon!)</em><br />\nQ: Ideal pet?<br />\n<strong>A: I am very certain it doesn&#8217;t get better than golden doodles, specifically a certain golden doodle I know named Treacle.</strong><br />\nQ: What would constitute a perfect day for you?<br />\n<strong>A: I would wake up listening to seagulls and lobster boats on the water in Maine. My husband John and dog Treacle and I would spend the day swimming in the ocean, reading in the sun (well, maybe not Treacle), and picnicking on my family&#8217;s boat. We&#8217;d then finish the day with a lobster cook out with our family and best friends, and spend the evening around a fire under the stars. </strong><br />\nQ: If you were to die and come back as a person or thing, what do you think it would be?<br />\n<strong>A: A golden doodle.</strong> <em>(Noticing a theme here&#8217;)</em><br />\nQ: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?<br />\n<strong>A: Is this a real ability or imaginary? If it&#8217;s the latter, I would say to fly. If it&#8217;s the former, I would say to be able to sing like Jill Scott.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nMad lib bio snapshot:<br />\n<u>Ellie Perkins Jowers</u> was born in <u>Damariscotta, ME</u>.
