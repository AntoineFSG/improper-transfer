Although a difficult topic to define clearly, one writer claims the main objective of gamification is to make reality suck a whole lot less. Another warns leaders to do their research because the concept is also surrounded by myth. One thing they all agree on is that games and gamification are not the same.</p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">How to move beyond the games</h4>\n<p class=\"p2\">On the WeSpire <a href=\"/platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">platform</a>, we don&#8217;t treat sustainability or employee engagement as a game, we use game mechanics to help people live healthier and more sustainably in real-life. In particular, we use five main game mechanics for employee engagement gamification in our platform to motivate employees to take positive steps at work, at home and in their communities.</p>\n<h5 class=\"p2\"><strong>1. Points </strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p1\">On WeSpire, we help people understand which actions have high impact and which ones have lower impact by translating hard to understand environmental metrics into easy to understand points. People can earn points through completing actions, forming habits, completing projects and earning achievements. By seeing points add up, people are able to track their journey and <a href=\"/why-employee-recognition-may-be-as-easy-as-uploading-a-picture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feel good</a> about the progress they are making.</p>\n<h5 class=\"p2\"><strong>2. Achievements </strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p1\">People can earn achievements for completing projects, winning a competition, providing feedback or inviting others.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Achievements are a way to reward people for doing something well&#8217;whether that is something contributing to the health of the online community or demonstrating mastery in real-life.</p>\n<h5 class=\"p2\"><strong>3. Teams </strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p1\">From the beginning, users are broken up into teams (by office, department, interests, etc.) and their overall impact is calculated along with the points they earn for completing actions. Teams offer the opportunity for creative collaboration, competition and relationship building. This type of teamwork can enhance relationships that are critical for the long term.</p>\n<h5 class=\"p2\"><strong>4. Leaderboards</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p1\">While there is an organizational teams leaderboard, each individual team has its own leaderboard to show members how they are contributing to the group&#8217;s progress. To show users how they compare to others&#8217;as individuals or in teams&#8217;competitive projects are time-based, team-based, and also include individualized leaderboards. Leaderboards allow for friendly competition that sparks motivation, inspiration, and the desire to win. Sometimes biking to work is all it takes to surpass your competitor!</p>\n<h5 class=\"p2\"><strong>5. Levels</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p1\">Competitive and collaborative projects give users something to strive towards, and educate users about what kind of impact is possible through broad engagement. Through the platform, users are able to set goals and reach for higher levels of impact.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Levels represent the progression of accomplishments and the journey of a win. A competitive level system enables players and teams to move forward over time to higher levels of accomplishment, again sparking <a href=\"/the-secret-to-employee-engagement-find-out-what-motivates-your-employees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">motivation</a> and the drive to succeed.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Using these 5 main game mechanics, we are able to help employees reach their sustainability goals by keeping them motivated and having fun.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\"><i><a href=\"/demo\"><img class=\"  alignleft wp-image-128\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fp-featured-content-img-300x152.png\" alt=\"demo employee engagement gamification\" width=\"167\" height=\"85\" /></a><a href=\"/demo\">Request a demo</a> of WeSpire&#8217;s employee engagement platform</i><em> to learn how your organization can use employee engagement gamification and game mechanics backed by applied behavioral science to drive measurable, positive impact.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n","slug":"5-ways-to-use-game-mechanics-in-employee-engagement","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"6e0bdd0a-d2f8-5e9b-88b5-600e3c58d41d"}}}
