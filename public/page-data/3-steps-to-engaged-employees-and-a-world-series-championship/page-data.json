An ESPN reporter described the team&#8217;s culture as toxic.<!--more--><br />\nBut twelve months later, the <a href=\"http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=bos\">Red Sox</a> had ascended from last place in their division to World Series champions. While there are many reasons why the Red Sox won the World Series, higher engagement is one of the biggest. A stronger culture, greater team cohesion, and a more purposeful mission all boosted the team&#8217;s performance in 2013, even while it cut its payroll by $15 million.</p>\n<h3>How to engage employees</h3>\n<p>Companies looking for how to engage employees can learn from Boston&#8217;s bearded champions. Here are three steps to driving employee engagement, based on how the Red Sox empowered their players and became the best team in baseball:</p>\n<h4><strong> Define your culture</strong></h4>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.aon.com/human-capital-consulting/\">Aon Hewitt</a>, best employer companies display significantly stronger cultures than average companies and outperform the average company on revenue growth, operating margin and total shareholder return.&#8221; In preparation for the 2013 season, new team manager John Farrell described the culture he planned to build in Boston as one of tolerance, one of encouragement, one of holding one another accountable. He continued, I think if you&#8217;re sincere and respect one another, those are the attributes that lead to chemistry.&#8221; Red Sox players immediately embraced these core values, holding each other accountable for working hard 100% of the time as evidenced by the fact that the Red Sox never lost more than three games in a row all season. Outfielder Johnny Gomes noted that, it&#8217;s pretty easy to say, &#8216;Play hard &#8217;till the last out,&#8217; but you&#8217;re seeing this team actually do it.</p>\n<h4><strong> Create a cohesive team</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alanehall.com/\">Alan Hall</a>, author of <em>The 7 C&#8217;s of Hiring</em>, writes that three of the most important qualities to look for in potential employees are compatibility, character, and culture. After an embarrassing 2012 season, Red Sox team president Larry Lucchino explained the team&#8217;s new process for evaluating free agents: [General manager] Ben [Cherington] was particularly determined to bring in guys he thought would be great teammates. We don&#8217;t put that in front of talent, but it&#8217;s a very strong second. In fact, the team bonded so well that nearly every player <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/10/22/boston-red-sox-beards-st-louis-cardinals-world-series/3157395/\">grew a beard</a> to signify the group&#8217;s camaraderie. After his players lifted the championship trophy, Cherington said: We have a remarkable group of people in that clubhouse, who truly put winning first, put each other first, and had each other&#8217;s backs for nine months.</p>\n<h4><strong> Align around a purposeful mission</strong></h4>\n<p>A Deloitte <a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/us_leadership_2014corebeliefs&amp;culturesurvey_040414.pdf\">study</a> found that 73% of employees at purpose-driven companies are engaged, compared to just 23% at companies lacking a meaningful mission. The 2013 Red Sox strived not only to play well on the field, but also to redeem themselves for their failures in 2012. As Cherington put it, we were committed to get back to what we wanted to be as quickly as we could. The team was also motivated by the tragic Boston Marathon bombings, making enormous efforts to support the injured and help the city recover. Players hung a 617 jersey (Boston&#8217;s area code) in the <a href=\"http://nesn.com/2013/04/red-sox-hang-boston-strong-no-617-jersey-in-dugout-during-tuesdays-game-photo/\">dugout</a> during games, and before each home game they honored heroes and victims from the attack.<br />\nWhen thinking about how to engage employees, case studies like the Red Sox demonstrate how creating cohesion and collaboration, and adopting a purposeful mission can significantly improve a group&#8217;s efficiency and create positive outcomes. Your company goals may not involve a World Series championship, but employee engagement can drive the productivity, employee retention, and innovation necessary to succeed in today&#8217;s business world.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\"  alignleft wp-image-335\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire blog about how to engage employees\" width=\"158\" height=\"56\" /></a>Like what you just read? <a href=\"/blog\">Visit the WeSpire blog and subscribe</a> to receive the latest employee engagement articles delivered straight into your inbox.</em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"3-steps-to-engaged-employees-and-a-world-series-championship","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"23b69d5a-53b1-5a51-b5c2-14b9333fbb90"}}}
