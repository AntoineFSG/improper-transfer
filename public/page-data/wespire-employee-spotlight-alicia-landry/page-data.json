At WeSpire we are extremely fortunate to have a number of amazing teammates, all working to bring purpose to employees at companies large and small around the world.</span><br />\n<!--more--><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We like to shine the spotlight on one member of the WeSpire team, to give you a peek into the remarkable workforce behind our award winning employee engagement platform.</span><br />\nPlease say Hello to our newest team member, <strong>Alicia Landry</strong>, one of our marketing interns, with whom I had the pleasure of sitting down for this special spotlight interview.<br />\n<b>Hannah: What are the top 5 most-used apps on your phone?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Snapchat, Instagram, Spotify, Weather App, Soundcloud</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What do you appreciate most about your childhood?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For the first four years of my life, it was just me and my mom. It was really nice and I think I did a lot of things that a lot of children don&#8217;t get to do. I used to miss school to go to California because my mom&#8217;s close friend lived there. I think I learned a lot getting to see another part of the world.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Who is your role model and why?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Definitely my mom. She pretty much took on the role of two parents for a while. She is super awesome. That&#8217;s such a nerdy thing to say, but I think she is the most selfless person I know. Everything she does has always been for her kids.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: You have to go on vacation for two weeks, all expenses paid. Where to?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Greece. My dad&#8217;s family is Greek, so I grew up around Greek culture. We planned this huge family vacation there, but unfortunately, it was right at the time when the riots broke out so we didn&#8217;t get the opportunity to go. I&#8217;m still patiently waiting to go! </span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What&#8217;s your favorite way to save money?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Cooking instead of eating out.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: If you were to die and come back as a thing, what would it be?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think a giraffe. It would be cool to see the world from their height, and they have awesome tongues.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: If you were in charge, what would you fix?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There&#8217;s so much to fix&#8217;I guess right now it&#8217;s a toss up between the education gap and mass incarceration. For now, I&#8217;ll go with the education gap.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I mean, I like to think nothing, as long as it&#8217;s in good fun. However, if the joke involves someones core identity, that might cross the line.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What is your dream job?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I&#8217;d love to work with kids incorporating sustainability and helping the environment, but right now I have no idea what that role might be. </span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Favorite place?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think my favorite place is Turks and Caicos. It&#8217;s so beautiful there and everyone is so welcoming. It&#8217;s a small island and everyone knows each other. I actually have friends there who I still keep in touch with on Instagram and Snapchat.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Favorite song and why?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is tough&#8217; If I Ruled the World by Nas because I love the message and it&#8217;s really empowering to listen to, especially for kids of color.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Favorite meal that you cooked recently?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I make this pasta that has an avocado sauce with tomatoes and spinach. I use the different colored tomatoes to make it look pretty and then I take pictures!</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: Starbucks or Dunkin&#8217; Donuts?</b><br />\n<b>A:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Starbucks.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What would constitute a perfect day for you?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Waking up early enough so I could get to the gym, spend a solid two and a half hours there, and then, go to the beach. The day would be hot but not too hot and I&#8217;d have my really good friends around. Of course, there has to be good food involved, including lobster guacamole, because that&#8217;s my favorite!. I&#8217;d end the day watching the planes fly over at Castle Island.</span><br />\n<b>Hannah: What was your motivation for joining WeSpire?</b><br />\n<b>Alicia:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I am passionate about sustainability, but I know I&#8217;m not the type of person to spend my time researching behind the scenes, I really liked how WeSpire engages employees in sustainability and gives people the opportunity to not only learn how to be more sustainable but also take action.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mad lib bio snapshot:</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><u>Alicia Landry</u></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> grew up right outside of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><u>Boston in Brookline, MA</u></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Her colleagues at WeSpire have no idea <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">that </span></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for as long as she can remember she has wanted two pigs named Olivia and Oliver.</span></span></p>\n","slug":"wespire-employee-spotlight-alicia-landry","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"b8d6b40e-ca05-54ad-ba49-919a10311afb"}}}
