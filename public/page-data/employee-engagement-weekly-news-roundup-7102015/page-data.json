Press about how CSR programs are beneficial to businesses is prevalent; however, there aren&#8217;t always clear numbers associated with these claims. Until now. Babson College and IO Sustainability have published a study quantifying the exact ROI companies can expect from pursuing CSR efforts. The notable findings? Companies can see up to a <strong>20% price premium</strong> from corporate responsibility, and at the same time, companies <strong>can reduce their credit spreads by 40%</strong>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/young-entrepreneur-council/the-pros-and-cons-of-impl_b_7657810.html\">The Pros and Cons of Implementing Gamification in the Workplace</a></h3>\n<p><strong>Competition, achievement, and status</strong>: motives that draw Millennials to gaming. <strong>Altruism, community, and collaboration</strong>: benefits companies see from attracting new talent with gamification in the workplace. C-suite executives today are finding that they can apply gamification to areas like recruiting, training, and HR compliance to see measurable increases in engagement and employee interest. Yet, the author cautions that although gamification confers notable benefits to the workplace, it is not a cure-all for every workplace problem. Managers should still utilize other methods of learning and a variety of motivators to keep employees engaged.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/danpontefract/2015/07/09/working-anywhere-anytime/ \">Working Anywhere Anytime </a></h3>\n<p>When the author was first presented with a brand new office at his next job, his immediate thought was whether or not he would be able to give it back&#8217;preferring instead to be able to work from anywhere. While old-school managers would scoff at this flexibility, it has proven to increase employee engagement levels at TELUS <strong>from 57% to 85%</strong>. When employees have complete control over their own schedules, they can tune in during their most productive hours and waste less time. What&#8217;s more, as an added bonus, companies can reduce the number of commuters and subsequent carbon emissions.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.inc.com/david-van-rooy/high-impact-hr-for-entrepreneurs-a-cautionary-perspective.html?cid=sf01001\">High Impact HR for Entrepreneurs: A Cautionary Perspective</a></h3>\n<p>Implementing HR in your company these days is harder than it used to be, and not many executives are getting it right: according to a Deloitte study, <strong><em>business leaders on average rate HR effectiveness as a D+</em></strong>. That&#8217;s almost a failing grade. Based on data from Aon Hewitt, the article outlines <strong>4 key areas</strong> that an effective HR program must cover in order to retain top talent. Through guiding questions, evaluate the effectiveness of your organization&#8217;s HR program and pinpoint potential areas of improvement.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/organizational_change/chris_oestereich/how_find_lasting_motivation_engagement_work\">How to Find Lasting Motivation and Engagement at Work</a></h3>\n<p>Only 30% of the workforce, according to Gallup, are actively engaged each day at work and wake up refreshed and invigorated. How do you become one of those people? While there is a lot that can be done at the organizational level to improve employee engagement, there are also a number of ways individuals can actively improve their own engagement. This article provides a roadmap for individuals to align themselves with passion/ purpose to reap the highest rewards. Instead of viewing engagement as solely the product of your work environment, there are steps employees can take to improve their own engagement: recognize your unique skills, and locate a workplace that will value them. If you succeed, you, too, can be the person who jumps out of bed every morning, rearing to go.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/hr-metrics-employee-engagement/\">Employee Engagement Strategy: New HR Metrics &amp; the Catalysts for Activating an Engaged Workforce</a></h3>\n<p>Employee engagement continues to persist as a critical business challenge, with <strong>87% of employees disengaged in their work globally</strong>. Today&#8217;s workforce demands purposeful work, and meaningful connections with their colleagues and supervisors.
