As the WeSpire team looks back at 2015 we&#8217;re amazed at what our customers have been able to achieve harnessing the power of the WeSpire <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/employee-engagement-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">platform</a>.<br />\n<!--more-->Our customers are obsessed with creating positive impact within their organizations. Nothing makes our team happier than being able to provide them with a platform to enable and measure the critical impact they&#8217;ve had on their organizations.</p>\n<h2>The Impact Our Customers Made in 2015</h2>\n<blockquote><p>In total, our customers got their employees to participate in more than 1.8 MILLION positive actions.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Holiday-Infographic.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1339\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Holiday-Infographic-615x1024.jpg\" alt=\"WeSpire Customer Impact\" width=\"615\" height=\"1024\" /></a><br />\nThese actions took place across all different categories: environmental sustainability, volunteerism, on-boarding and training, health and wellness and many more. Our customers were able to make a lasting positive impact on the lives of their employees. At the same time, these customers also enabled their employees to make a lasting <strong>positive impact</strong> on the world we live in&#8217;adding purpose to their work.<br />\nIn 2015, employees saved <strong>28 million pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions</strong>. <em>That&#8217;s a lot. 14 thousand tons, to be precise</em>. Diverting that much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is equivalent to taking 2,665 cars off the road for a year!<br />\nOur customers didn&#8217;t stop there:<br />\nWeSpire users saved more than<strong> 22 million kWh of energy</strong> in 2015. What&#8217;s a kWh, you ask? It&#8217;s a unit of electric energy, and 22 million of them is a lot. Actions like switching to LED lightbulbs or unplugging your phone once it&#8217;s charged can all add up to a big number like this one.<br />\nWeSpire customers saved<strong> 2,577 trees this year</strong>. That&#8217;s a forest of paper-manufacturing savings, with related environmental impacts, including a tree&#8217;s ability to provide shade&#8217;super important on a sizzling day&#8217;and capture dangerous particulates, e.g. CO2.</p>\n<blockquote><p>More than 1.3 million pounds of waste were saved. That&#8217;s enough to fill 607 dumpster trucks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Water: a hot topic in 2015, with California suffering from one of the worst droughts in our country&#8217;s history. WeSpire customers boosted their employees&#8217; H2O awareness on how simple actions like turning off the tap, or running full loads of dishes and laundry can have a BIG impact on saving this precious resource. Our customers saved <strong>40+ million gallons of water</strong> in 2015. Assuming water consumption of one gallon per day, <em>at this rate we could hydrate the inhabitants of Texas, Florida, Wisconsin, and Paris!</em><br />\nFuel prices plummeted famously in 2015, and fuel consumption among WeSpire users did the same: together we saved more than <strong>half a million gallons of fuel</strong>. <em>Enough to power a typical Marine corps combat brigade for one </em>day . Which makes us curious: what if the Marines decided to use the WeSpire platform?<br />\nStay tuned for updates in 2016!<br />\n<strong>Interested in harnessing the power of your co-workers to boost employee engagement while at the same time reduce waste and improve efficiencies?
