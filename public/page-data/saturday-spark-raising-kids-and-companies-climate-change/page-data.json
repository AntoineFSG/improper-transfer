At his question, she just shook her head and said, “I think we are doomed.”</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ironically, I had just had a </span>similar conversation with someone who may have a lot of funds and a whole lot of power, for up to eight years, not just 24 hours, starting in 2020. A critical question was whether nuclear fusion and carbon capture would be ready in time. The consensus of the scientists and innovators around the table was that it’s critical to invest in both, but it’s a long shot. So I asked my son, “Can I invent something or does it have to be a realistic solution”? &nbsp;He decided on realism, although he hoped a vacuum existed that could suck up all the carbon.<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My answer was decidedly more boring to him than a carbon vacuum. I said I would immediately implement a very high global tax on carbon pollution.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He seemed puzzled so I tried to explain it in “snowblower economics,” since that’s how he earns money. Imagine that when you snowblow a driveway, you have to pay a tax for the amount of carbon you emit. If you use a gas snowblower, you have to pay $10. But if you use an electric one, you don’t have to pay a tax because mom and dad purchase renewable energy. Which would you use? Now imagine everyone in the whole world starts to decide that way. He got it. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[For those who would like a less simplistic explanation, here is a </span></i><a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/reduce-emissions/cap-trade-carbon-tax\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">carbon pricing 101</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> guide from the Union of Concerned Scientists].</span></i><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you are a parent or a leader these days, you need to be prepared for this “what should we be doing” conversation. My kids might be a little more sensitized, but they aren’t yet among the tens of thousands marching in </span><a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/03/kids-climate-march-strikes-around-the-world-fridaysforfuture/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fridays for Future</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> school strikes. The Green New Deal was universally defeated for a complex set of political reasons, but some of the core ideas will re-emerge in a better bill soon. The most important message in climate, whether talking to kids, employees or community members </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/on-parenting/ways-to-help-kids-cope-with--and-help-combat--climate-change/2019/01/21/f7cc6424-180a-11e9-9ebf-c5fed1b7a081_story.html?\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is agency</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As one climate scientist states, “The science news is depressing. The good news is in the solutions&#8230;Depression is fed by a sense of hopelessness and helplessness. It’s all about framing. How am I going to act? What am I going to do? Because action feeds hope feeds action feeds hope.”</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I certainly do not want my kids, or my employees, feeling like they are doomed. Therefore, I perceive my role as a leader, and a mother, to be focused on solutions and to embrace and promote as many as we can, both personally and professionally. </span><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WeSpire </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is broader now, but was built originally to educate and inspire personal sustainable behavior change at work and at home, like eating less meat, switching to renewable energy, and choosing low carbon commuting options. I would like to see every business commit to 100% renewable energy and join the </span><a href=\"http://there100.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RE100</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I am a big fan of how Microsoft </span><a href=\"https://www.greenbiz.com/article/how-microsofts-internal-price-carbon-saved-it-10-million-year\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cascaded their internal carbon tax</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to every business unit to change employee awareness and behavior. Every company should consider that model, both to create a significant impact on their own operations, but also to be prepared for a world with a price on carbon. </span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because being prepared is the other part of leadership. If you haven’t checked out </span><a href=\"https://gisgeography.com/climate-change-effects-maps/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a climate risk map</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your home or key business or supplier locations, look at it (although I recommend a glass of wine in hand when you do). At WeSpire HQ, our office is </span><a href=\"https://choices.climatecentral.org/#16/42.3570/-71.0576?compare=temperatures&amp;carbon-end-yr=2100&amp;scenario-a=warming-4&amp;scenario-b=warming-2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in the ocean</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a 2 degree rise, a risk made very real when the Boston Harbor </span><a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/01/04/here-how-bad-coastal-flooding-was-during-thursday-storm/HCU6EZbtcN94FfScmuGM3M/story.html?p1=Article_Related_Box_Article\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inundated</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> downtown last year. Our data center, in Northern Virginia, has less risk from sea level rise, but faces risk from internal flooding and extreme heat. If you haven’t met your corporate risk team, meet them, ask what they are preparing for, and how you can help. If you don’t have a risk team, volunteer to lead a climate resiliency task force. </span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hopeful part is that it’s still solvable in the time we have left. Yes, it will require unprecedented global change. Not just a price on carbon, but also a rapid move to electric vehicles, massive rollouts of renewable energy, ending deforestation, moving buildings off natural gas and more. Acting now is our best hope for a day when our kids are in their twenties and our younger employees are progressing into leadership roles, where we can look them in the eye and tell them what we did, now, that worked to fix the climate. Because action fed hope fed action fed hope and the alternative was unacceptable.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Quote of the day</strong>: &nbsp;Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better.

The result is that I read, think, and learn a lot about the intersection of purpose, impact and leadership and have a few successes and a lot more “lessons learned.” I realized that my own insights may be helpful to other purpose-driven professionals if I took the time to reflect each week.If you find this inspiring, practical or helpful, I’d be honored if you shared it with your colleagues, your families and your friends.<br />\nRead Previous Week&#8217;s Spark: <a href=\"https://www.wespire.com/saturday-spark-im-here-for-the-mission/\">I&#8217;m Here for the Mission</a><br />\n[DISPLAY_ULTIMATE_SOCIAL_ICONS]\n</div>\n","slug":"saturday-spark-raising-kids-and-companies-climate-change","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"a7033bc9-1fb6-5303-b0c3-374678f3d20d"}}}
