Often, you know you want to make a change, but getting from <em>wanting</em> to build a positive habit and actually <em>following through</em>, can be really difficult. In fact, <strong>on average, it takes 66 days of doing an action before it becomes a habit</strong> (Source: <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/forming-new-habits_b_5104807.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Huffington Post</a>). One way to boost <a href=\"/the-secret-to-employee-engagement-find-out-what-motivates-your-employees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">motivation</a> is to use incentives. Gyms, for example, offer promotions, but this only incentivizes you to join the gym, not necessarily change your behavior.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h4>Positive Impact by the Numbers</h4>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"http://www.gym-pact.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GymPact</a>, an app developed by the innovative San Francisco startup, Pact. Pact created an app anyone can signup for that provides the motivation needed to get you to the gym, not only in January and February, but always. Their secret: tying your workouts to a financial incentive.<br />\nEvery week, GymPact users have a goal for the number of workouts they must complete. If users succeed in reaching their goal, they split the pool of funds from those users who did not meet their pact and are required to pay-in. CEO and Co-Founder <a href=\"http://www.gym-pact.com/team.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yifan Zhang</a> visited WeSpire headquarters and spoke about the success of the financial incentive, and explained how 92% of their users had achieved their weekly pact.<br />\nDuring her visit, Yifan emphasized the importance of tracking progress and impact to keep users motivated. Similarly, the WeSpire platform tracks the environmental and financial impact of every action taken by each individual, and then aggregates that to determine the company-wide impacts.<br />\n<strong>Having this impact data immediately available creates an instant motivation for users. They are able to see the impact from <a href=\"/employee-engagement-small-actions-big-savings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one small action</a>, which in turn empowers them and their peers to continue to form positive habits.</strong></p>\n<h4>The Network Effect of Actions</h4>\n<p>To give you an example of this in action, lets look at turning the water off while washing your hands. On average, every time you shut off the tap while applying soap, you save 0.2 gallons of water. While this may not seem like a lot, if you do some simple multiplication using common averages, the impact grows quickly. If you form a habit of turning the water off every time you wash your hands, you&#8217;ll save 1.9 gallons of water a day, adding up to about 13 gallons per week, nearly 60 gallons per month, and over 680 gallons of water a year (or 11 kiddie pools!).<br />\n<img title=\"Individual Action Table\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/217956/file-1972847706-png/GymPact_Blog_Post_Table_1.png?t=1423778295545\" alt=\"Individual Action Table\" width=\"627\" /><br />\nWhere GymPact and WeSpire differ is with collective action. WeSpire&#8217;s employee engagement programs not only encourage one person to start making a positive impact, they also inspire entire company workforces using the power of collective action. What if you were able to get your whole team, or better yet, your whole company to change their behavior on the way they wash their hands? If your company had 500 people, that would equal 341,000 gallons of water saved in one year.<br />\n<img title=\"Collective Action Table\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/217956/file-1973289150-png/GymPact_Blog_Post_Table_2.png?t=1423778295545\" alt=\"Collective Action Table\" width=\"625\" /></p>\n<h4>The ROI of Employee Engagement Programs</h4>\n<p>Financially, this adds up for a company: the average price per gallon of water in the U.S. is 1 cent, meaning a company of 500 could save about $3,400 if everyone turned the <a href=\"/droughtbusters-the-7-7-million-gallons-of-water-that-didnt-go-down-the-drain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">water</a> off while washing their hands!<br />\nThere is power in numbers; whether it is financial incentive-driven like <a href=\"http://www.gym-pact.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GymPact</a> or collective action-driven like <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WeSpire</a>.
