Which makes us think that all of you BWPs out there could ask your co-workers for their advice on the subject of work-and-family. You might be surprised, as we were, by your colleagues&#8217; ingenuity&#8217;and by the support that comes from banding together!<br />\nHere are our favorites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hire a college student to work every Saturday night of the year.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Take kids on your errands.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Get a financial advisor.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Make really boring tasks fun.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Drink lots of coffee.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t let your work be a mystery.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read on! And please contribute your ideas in the comments!</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create theme nights</strong> to simplify shopping and cooking, like Taco Nights or Pasta Bar.<em> </em></li>\n<li><strong>Use Evernote</strong> to have your to list synched across every device.</li>\n<li><strong>Hire a college student to work every Saturday night of the year.</strong> It saves a ton of time spent searching for sitters and gets you out with your partner even without a formal plan or event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Susan Hunt Stevens, Founder and CEO</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Take kids on your errands.  </strong>It can often be a great time especially if you make it fun and, even if it isn&#8217;t, you need to get stuff done.</li>\n<li><strong>Let your kids play.  </strong>If kids are playing on their own, don&#8217;t feel like since you are home and taking care of them, you need to be involved or somehow you aren&#8217;t a good parent or aren&#8217;t spending quality time&#8217; with them. Instead, get stuff done around the house or for work, or just relax. You&#8217;ll need it for when they start screaming for you, which inevitably will happen.</li>\n<li><strong>The One kid at a time trick.</strong>  If you have multiple kids, they can often ask for stuff all at once.  It drives me crazy! The trick is to ask for quiet and then list out what they need in the order you are going to do it.  This helps you remember what needs to get done and lets them know you heard them. I am not good at multi-tasking, and this helps me stay sane.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em> </em>Ben Livermore, Senior Software Engineer</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Outsource as many administrative tasks as possible:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Grocery shopping</strong> (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/\">Instacart</a>). We grocery shop on-the-go and get it delivered.</li>\n<li><strong>Get a financial advisor</strong>&#8216;this can vary from cheap to expensive. We have one through Ameriprise based on a great recommendation. We also have someone do our taxes. Use <a href=\"http://mint.com/\">com</a> to review regularly.</li>\n<li><strong>House cleaning</strong>&#8216; plenty of services out there make it easy to do this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these things give us more time to spend with the little devils. I would also include, hire an au pair&#8217; I don&#8217;t know how we ever lived without this flexible child care.<br />\nNish Murthy, Director of Customer Success &amp; Sales</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Find a great babysitter that your kids love as much as you do. </strong>We met our babysitter at our daughter&#8217;s after-school program.</li>\n<li><strong>Make really boring tasks fun.</strong> My daughter hated to go grocery shopping and would complain like crazy until I started making a game of the most mundane tasks. You can find us throwing rolls of paper towels down the aisles to one another and then slamming them into our carriage like we just scored game winning touch down every weekend.</li>\n<li><strong>Make friends with your neighbors.</strong> We&#8217;re really lucky to have neighbors who have kids in the same age range who love to play together. It&#8217;s awesome that a play date can happen at any time, all you have to do is see if there&#8217;s a car in the driveway.</li>\n<li><strong>Get a dog!</strong> My daughter and our dog are best of friends. They will play hide n seek together for hours. I&#8217;m not sure which one of them likes it more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kate Adams, Marketing Director</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plan and prep when you can</strong>&#8216;if you have time on Sunday, prep a simple meal or two for the upcoming week, so you can just throw it in the microwave for dinner. If you prepare lunches for your kids, get things ready the night before (cut up veggies, wash fruit, etc.). I recently got great advice from a babysitter that her mom would make lots of PB &amp; J sandwiches and freeze them, so she could grab them for last minute lunches.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep kids on schedule</strong>&#8216;Kids are creatures of habit and like to know what&#8217;s next. In the a.m.&#8217;s my kids know exactly what they need to do to make the bus on time, and while they sometimes need reminders, they never miss the bus. I have an after school checklist for my sitter to keep the kids on track with homework, reading, instruments, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Drink lots of coffee</strong>&#8216;while we&#8217;re taught to sleep 8 hours, that&#8217;s an impossible feat for the working parent. If you drive your kids around to sports after work, help them with homework, check e-mails after kids go to bed and try to fit in an early morning workout before starting all over again, you are sleep deprived.  Caffeine helps!</li>\n<li><strong>Have a sense of humor</strong>&#8216;it&#8217;s okay for the kids to see that we all make mistakes and must recover, so whether it&#8217;s going to the wrong hockey rink, mixing up the kids&#8217; lunches or forgetting that it&#8217;s 1/2 day, you have to smile and keep going. It&#8217;s a great life lesson for the kiddos!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kim Pelzar, Human Resources</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t let your work be a mystery.</strong> You are acutely aware of work-life balance&#8217;rushing to get home on time, juggling surprise snow days, dealing with childcare hassles, etc. etc. But consider the kids&#8217; point of view: what do they know about this mysterious work that competes with them for your time, and that sometimes stresses you out? Talk with them about your job: why it matters, why you like your company, how you feel about a good day at work. Bring them to the office if you can, let them see what you do&#8217;and why you enjoy doing it! As they grow up, this will help them find a career they love.</li>\n<li><strong>When you&#8217;re with your kids, be unplugged from your office communications</strong>. Give them your full attention. If something urgent comes up, explain to them that you have to take care of it&#8217;and why you do (see #1 above).</li>\n<li><strong>Pack your work stuff, your lunch, your gym gear, along with your kids&#8217;.</strong> Show them all the ways you keep organized and healthy. You have healthy routines in common!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sarah Finnie Robinson, Founding Partner</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>Finally, just in time for Valentine&#8217;s Day:</em></strong><br />\n<strong>There are two types of people</strong><strong>&#8216;</strong><strong>those who know what it&#8217;s like to have small children at home, and those that don&#8217;t.  </strong>Make sure to spend time being with your significant other whenever your kids are not in a feral state (or worse). Just for a few moments a day, be the husband, be the wife, or be the whatever with that other person.<br />\nStuart Weisenberg, Director of Finance<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n","slug":"at-work-best-practices-for-busy-working-parents","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"8cce1e9e-52a9-520b-932d-2eb2eca47ac0"}}}
