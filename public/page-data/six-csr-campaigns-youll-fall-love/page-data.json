This campaign encourages good habit formation or bad habit breaking based on what the employee is hoping to achieve.<br />\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>Why we love it: Employees support each other in reaching their goals, and it holds employees accountable for the habits they&#8217;re trying to make or break. </em></span><br />\n<strong>Community Bulletin </strong><br />\nLooking for a way to capture and share the ongoing conversations your employees are having? Implement a campaign like this to provide an opportunity for employees to communicate with each other about their personal lives and interests. Employees are constantly looking for outlets to socialize, gain trusted feedback and truly become a part of their community. It also provides you with insight into your workforces&#8217; interests better equipping you for new campaign content down the line.<br />\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>Why we love it: It gives employees a chance to share their personal interests with their colleagues and connect on a deeper level.</em></span><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wespire-volunteers-and-heres-why-we-think-its-important/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Volunteerism</strong></a><br />\nThis campaign is all about getting out in the community and helping to make the world a better place.

Inspire employees to share a comment about someone or something that they are thankful for and continue to promote a positive working environment.<br />\n<em><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Why we love it: Expressing gratitude is a simple act that can truly move the needle on creating a more positive company culture.</span> </em><br />\n<strong>The Active 150</strong><br />\nThe American Heart Association advises that individuals should try to be active for at least thirty minutes a day, five times a week. This campaign is centered around helping employees achieve that standard on their own terms. Implement this campaign to encourage employees to share what they did, to get active, while inspiring other employees to get involved.<br />\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>Why we love it: Supporting your employees in achieving their health and well-being goals not only improves your employees&#8217; lives, it can be a huge cost saving for your organization.    </em></span><br />\nDoes your organization have a swoon-worthy CSR campaign?
