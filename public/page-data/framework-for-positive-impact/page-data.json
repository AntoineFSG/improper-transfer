Every organization, business unit, and program leader will have different strengths and therefore a different starting point when it comes to our framework. Take the time to understand each of the four C&#8217;s and tackle the one that you think is the most manageable for you and your organization.<br />\nGet your organization to <strong>commit</strong> to the positive impact initiative you are working on. In order to do so, it&#8217;s important to gain the<a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/executive-support-and-leadership-in-change-management-1917803\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> support of the C-suite</a>. When employees know their leaders are taking the programs seriously they will respond more positively to the change.<br />\nIn order to gain the trust and support of your C-suite, you need have an open and honest discussion about your organization&#8217;s goals, and clearly show how the program(s) you&#8217;re proposing will help achieve them. Goals related to cost savings, employee recruitment and retention, branding and more can all be positively influenced by positive impact programs.<br />\n<strong>Communication</strong> is extremely important in ensuring the success and effectiveness of your positive impact programs. Employees are bombarded with e-mails and messages from various business departments on a daily basis, so make sure your messaging is consistent, visual, drives awareness, and includes a call to action.<br />\nTo ensure stickiness and engagement, it&#8217;s important to <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/qs_detailwhite_paperqs_resource_nameeeinterestsurvey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">take your employees interests</a> into account, but you also stay focused on your organization&#8217;s mission, vision and goals. Employees want to feel heard, and valued, so share your goals with them and gather their feedback. It&#8217;s a great way to<strong> connect</strong> employees to business goals and provide them with opportunities to get involved in reaching those goals.<br />\nDefine what you want <strong>change</strong>,<strong> </strong>as it relates to your positive impact programming, to look like at your organization early on. Do you want 30 percent of your organization to participate in a corporate volunteer event? Maybe you want everyone to participate in one health and wellness event a year. Whatever you&#8217;re trying to achieve, it&#8217;s important to set quantitative goals so you can measure the change you&#8217;re making.. Setting these goals early on will allow you the opportunity to set benchmarks, measure your progress, and provide real evidence to your leaders on how these programs are positively impacting the overall goals of your organization.<br />\n<em>Another best practice; celebrate your wins, no matter how small. Small steps in the right direction, can create huge change, don&#8217;t underestimate the power of your positive impact programs, and remember all good things take time.</em></p>\n","slug":"framework-for-positive-impact","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"bd9485c5-1885-54ec-9092-42ff139e7b58"}}}
