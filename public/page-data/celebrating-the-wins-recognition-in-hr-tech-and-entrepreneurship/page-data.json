We started with a visit to the <a href=\"http://www.hrotodayforum.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HRO Today Forum</a> in Philadelphia. Hosted by Executive Editor Debbie Bolla and her team, the event brought together HR leaders to discuss how the alignment of strategic goals can yield a positive workplace culture and additional business successes. HR executives met with industry thought leaders to review the latest research, attend interactive sessions, discuss the newest tools, and truly learn from one another.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nA highlight of the day was accepting WeSpire&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/press-room/wespire-wins-2015-tektonic-award/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TekTonic Award</a> in the HR Social Media category. It&#8217;s one of the first we&#8217;ve received from an organization focused broadly on HR technology. For once, I got to be the engagement person at a conference focused on trends in employee engagement, instead of the engagement person at a conference focused on sustainability. One of the presentations I found most interesting was by Shozo Mori, the CEO of Wilson Learning, who shared research that only 30% of Millennials say they want to be in top leadership positions in companies. This emerging leadership gap will require totally different approaches to career development in the next few years. He shared strategies for both encouraging young people to become interested in leadership and professional development programs that focus less on upward progression and more on new skill development.<br />\nFurthermore, in late May, we were invited to attend and serve as a provocateur at the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan Progress Update (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=USLPProgress&amp;src=typd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#USLPProgress</a>) This day gathers dozens of external partners and stakeholders who help advise Unilever, a global enterprise, in an effort to truly transform how the company does business. The day highlights the progress of the North American team against its goals, and the advisors share very openly about what is working and what is not. It was my third time attending, and it is honestly one of the most inspiring days of my year. This year proved to be similarly motivating for two reasons. First, the research shows that Unilever&#8217;s brands with purpose are growing twice as fast as traditional brands. Second, Unilever included a much broader group of employees in the meeting and has recognized the importance of creating a sustainability movement that is easy to join and includes feedback from employees. The fact that we are part of their team making that happen is something we feel so proud of everyday.<br />\nAnd last, but certainly not least, a team of us attended EY&#8217;s New England Entrepreneur of the Year Awards gala as a finalist. The event was beautiful &#8216; black tie with a sit down dinner, and everyone was celebrating the amazing work being done by thirty-five other incredible entrepreneurs in our region. When our name was announced as the last award of the night, no one was more shocked, or delighted, than I was.<br />\nAs I said in my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjf4hVJSRWA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acceptance speech</a>, the award isn&#8217;t just an achievement as an individual entrepreneur &#8216; it&#8217;s recognition of all the hard work the WeSpire team puts in every day. It&#8217;s recognition of WeSpire&#8217;s customers, who believe and prove that they can positively change the way their corporations engage their employees and society. And it&#8217;s for all of the other entrepreneurs out there who believe, as I do, that business can change the world for the better.
