As a new member of the workforce looking for entry-level positions, I did my fair share of research on different types of companies, positions and options. To be honest, I wasn&#8217;t sure what type of job I was looking for, but I knew I wanted to love going to work every day and a lot of that has to do with the culture of an organization.<br />\n<!--more-->Too many of my peers hate their jobs, are disengaged, work long hours, and ultimately are miserable at work day-in-and-day-out, and unfortunately they aren&#8217;t alone.<br />\nA recent <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/184061/employee-engagement-unmoved-june.aspx?g_source=employee%20engagement&amp;g_medium=search&amp;g_campaign=tiles\">Gallup study</a> revealed to us that the U.S.&#8217;s employee engagement statistics have remained unchanged since June, holding at a lousy 31.9%. That means 69.1% of the working population are actively disengaged in their workplaces.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Employee engagement is a leading indicator of future business success, and has discovered close ties between engagement and outcomes such as turnover, profitability and productivity. &#8211; <em>Gallup</em><strong><br />\n</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>With this growing trend, millennials like me are seeking out employers who make employee engagement a priority, and many of us are willing to accept a lower salary in order to find a company that offers a great learning environment, opportunities to get involved in the organization and community, and has a fun, supportive culture.<br />\nI&#8217;ll consider myself one of the lucky ones, though. I landed an internship with a company that already has this whole employee engagement thing figured out.<br />\nOn this blog, we focus a lot on the research and best practices that we&#8217;ve seen around employee engagement strategy, design, and program rollouts. We also love to refer to our customers as the best examples of how real companies with real challenges are addressing them through employee engagement. However, I want to share the unique, fun and productive ways WeSpire engages its employees and creates a cohesive workplace where everyone wants to be. Consider this insight into how we continuously improve and practice what we preach!<br />\n<strong>1. Volunteering and community involvement:</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/vSx-CZtYHr5lxCJTU5wpggG8ZyzBlWbyKr2oLrR8Vl4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1235 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/vSx-CZtYHr5lxCJTU5wpggG8ZyzBlWbyKr2oLrR8Vl4-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"employee volunteering\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>Volunteering together as a staff Is a great way to create a sense of community that is both constructive and rewarding for everyone involved. Two weeks ago, we had the opportunity to volunteer with our partner, Timberland, in their annual <a href=\"http://responsibility.timberland.com/service/17th-annual-serv-a-palooza-kicks-off/\">Serv-a-palooza</a>. We were tasked with building and installing fitness stations along the trails through Willand Pond in New Hampshire. The day was physically and mentally stimulating: everyone involved&#8217;no matter their title&#8217;was in a t-shirt and jeans raking, building, and working together to help the local community. The event really brought our team together, allowed for entirely new kinds of conversation, put our different skills to the test and was all for an amazing cause.<br />\nBeing new to the company, this event really provided me the opportunity to get to know my co-workers and connect with them in entirely new ways. I left the event feeling like I was part of an incredible team that truly made a difference.<br />\n<strong>2. Sustainability at work and at home</strong><br />\nFor those of you who aren&#8217;t aware, WeSpire&#8217;s roots are in sustainability engagement (our original name was <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/introducing-wespire/\">Practically Green</a>). Despite the company&#8217;s growth and product expansion, sustainability is still core to our mission and culture. It all begins at our office: we have a full recycling station where employees can recycle plastics, papers, glass and metals and compost leftover food waste. We have a full-service kitchen, which encourages employees to bring their meals and prepare them as they would at home, significantly decreasing food and packaging waste. Our bathrooms are equipped with dual-flush toilets and recycled paper products and hand towels near every sink. And finally&#8217;and perhaps most impactful&#8217;our office is perfectly located to be accessible via bike, subway, bus or commuter rail, therefore enabling over 95% of employees to rely on public transit.<br />\nWhen participating in sustainable actions is that easy, it&#8217;s hard for me to find excuses for not participating. Sustainability is ingrained in our office lifestyle and therefore our culture, and it&#8217;s common to hear my colleagues share ideas and advice for how to adapt similar behaviors at home and in their communities.<br />\n<strong>3. Lunch and Learn</strong><br />\nOnce a week, we have a companywide Lunch and Learn. Everyone who is able, gathers together for lunch to hear co-workers present on a topic they are passionate about (whether it be work-related or not). This is a great way to build a sense of internal community, provide an opportunity for learning, and gain an appreciation and understanding of those you work with. A few weeks ago, one of my co-workers presented to us about the Symphony. He brought his passion to work for a fun-filled hour of learning, music and conversation. Our Lunch and Learns have become wildly successful and generate interesting conversations, help the flow of creativity, and provide a much deserved break from our hectic days. As a new employee, I appreciate how the Lunch and Learns empower employees to get involved, learn from one another, and share ideas and passions in such an open and inviting environment.<br />\n<strong>4. Flexible Work Schedules and Pet Friendly Office</strong><br />\nPerhaps it is an added benefit of working at a technology startup, but remote communications technology has enabled our staff to work from wherever, whenever. Our ability to choose our own hours provides us the freedom to come into the office when we want as long as we&#8217;re able to get<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/dog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1237 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/dog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"pet friendly office\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> our work done and attend all of our meetings. Video conferencing allows our staff to virtually sit in on all company meetings, collaborate, and have important conversations without anyone missing a beat. Besides demonstrating the organization&#8217;s trust in employees and adding convenience, flexible work schedules are also an extremely sustainable option as it cuts down on commuting.<br />\nIn addition to offering flexible work schedules, WeSpire&#8217;s office is very pet friendly. We have a few, four-legged office celebrities including Zeus, Lucky, and Treacle. Having pets around the office makes for a fun, relaxed, and comfortable work environment. Office guests often say we have quite the welcome committee, too!<br />\n<strong>5. Do One Thing: Our own employee engagement software</strong><br />\nDo One Thing is our own version of WeSpire&#8217;s employee engagement <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/employee-engagement-platform/\">platform</a>, and is the tool that ties items 1-4 together. Our platform is managed by our content team and includes customized projects, or checklists of actions, that employees can join and take action around different WeSpire initiatives. Employees are able to post updates, like and comment on the activity of others, and find new actions to take in areas they are passionate about.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Capture.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-1233 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Capture-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"employee engagement platform\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\" /></a>For example, to gain awareness and participation for our Timberland volunteering event two weeks ago, employees registered for the event and logged their hours in the corresponding volunteering project on Do One Thing. The platform caters to everything involving WeSpire employee engagement, from enabling employees to earn points for positive behavior around sustainability to getting recognized for sharing their passion via Lunch and Learns. The platform gives our team the ability to get credit for their actions, interact with their colleagues, and challenge themselves to improve at work and at home. For our management team, the platform adds value because they can measure and track the real-time positive impact and savings our team has contributed to from all of our efforts.<br />\nThese are just some of the ways that WeSpire works hard to engage our team, but as we tell our customers: engagement is a journey, not a sprint. With the right mix of coordination, dedication, and the right tools in place, a company can combat the common engagement issues of today and succeed long-term. <strong>How is your organization engaging employees?
