From there, a company demonstrates how to succeed by delivering purpose to its employees, its customers and by building purpose throughout its organization.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nAaron Hurst, the author of <a href=\"http://purposeeconomy.com/book/\">The Purpose Economy</a>, purports that the value in the new economy lies in establishing purpose for employees and customers through serving needs greater than their own, enabling personal growth and building community.<br />\nSimilarly, a new survey just released from Deloitte (Global Human Capital Trends 2015) focusing on global organizations describes new world of work&#8217;one that requires company imperatives for leading, engaging, reinventing, and reimagining they way organizations run.</p>\n<h3>Action Plan for Employee Engagement</h3>\n<p>In building, running and growing a mission-driven company, there are some best practices that will help to demonstrate success:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Have Your Mission Drive Your Actions</strong>&#8216;It&#8217;s critical to create alignment, motivation and a sense of purpose within your organization so that it projects outwardly with customers, partners and shareholders. When the goal is clear, then rallying your organization around this purpose, then the mission is always tied to what you do.</li>\n<li><strong>Use Technology to Connect Employees through Shared Values and Vision</strong>&#8216;When technology is used to communicate and create awareness around goals, then your ability to quickly execute significantly increases while creating a sense of purposeful action throughout your organization.</li>\n<li><strong>Use Action-Based Projects to Align Your Organization Around Specific Priorities</strong>&#8216;The best employee engagement programs use individual projects centered around specific actions (corporate social responsibility and sustainability, volunteering, well-being, etc.)<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> which allows employees a choice of how they&#8217;d like to contribute to the greater good. </span></li>\n<li><strong>Use Team Building To Create Opportunities for Employee Fulfillment</strong>&#8216;When employees can work beyond their organizational boundaries in teams aligned to projects that are personally meaningful, they are more productive individually and as a group.</li>\n<li><strong>Gather Intelligence From Employee Actions and Impact</strong>&#8216;Feedback relating to employee and team actions sourced in real time can be synthesized for business stakeholders so that they can continue to scale and expand the collective impact of greater good.</li>\n<li><strong>Scale Your Employee Engagement Program with Intention</strong>&#8216;<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Purpose becomes the motivator for reinventing and reimagining opportunities for organizational impact; </span></li>\n<li><strong>Suggest Actions that Link Employees to the Greater Community</strong>&#8216;<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">One of the main drivers of purpose is building a community from within between employees that extends outside the organization to customers, shareholders and individuals and groups organized around sustainable good.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Instill a Sense of Purpose in Every Positive Action</strong>&#8216;P<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">lanet and profit can go together when employees are the drivers of change; when employees have a strong sense of purpose aligned with their employer, they are more productive and the company is more profitable.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;<em>The emergence of purpose as the new organizing principle in our economy is a product of our current moment in time.
