We were fortunate enough to have a few experts weigh in on the topic and thought you&#8217;d find their perspectives as helpful as we did.<!--more--><br />\nReb Rebele is the research manager for people analytics at The Wharton School. While he said there isn&#8217;t a vast amount of research on the differences, but he theorized that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recognition is the act of expressing appreciation or gratitude, making it more behavioral.</li>\n<li>Appreciation is about acknowledging the perceived value of something or someone. Appreciation is more of a cognitive act.</li>\n<li>Gratitude is more affective . It&#8217;s about feeling thankful, either as a direct beneficiary or on behalf of someone else.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Julianna Pillemer, a Ph.D. in management at Wharton, shared one article that also looked at gratitude vs. appreciation and the impact on life satisfaction outcomes to highlight the differences.  As she summarized:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"https://www.viacharacter.org/www/Portals/0/Relationships/Gratitude%20-%20indiv%20diffs%20in%20value%20%20meaning%20-%20Adler%20%20Fagley%20(2005).pdf\">Adler and Fagley (2005)</a> defined <strong>appreciation</strong> as acknowledging the value and meaning of something&#8217;an event, a person, a behavior, an object&#8217;and feeling a positive emotional connection to it  <em>Therefore, appreciation involves both cognition and affect</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Then, they actually conceptualize<strong> gratitude</strong> as a subcomponent of appreciation: The gratitude aspect of appreciation refers to noticing a benefit received (gifts, perceived efforts, sacrifices/actions on one&#8217;s behalf) and feeling grateful to someone for it. <em>It is a positive emotion directed to a benefactor for some perceived, intentional benefit.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Recognition</strong> is typically thought of as the behavioral expression of these internal states, whether <em>informally</em> (telling someone they did a great job) or <em>formally</em> (giving them an award or making a public announcement).</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, the article shows that appreciation has a significant affect on life satisfaction, distinctive from gratitude.  So as we go into this Thanksgiving week here in the US, certainly start by acknowledging the benefits you&#8217;ve received and express your gratitude for it<br />\nAnd finally, know that appreciation is good for your life satisfaction. I know that I&#8217;m appreciating institutions that are standing up loudly and clearly to defend the values of an inclusive society &#8216; whether it&#8217;s the faculties of Babson College,  the administration at the University of Pennsylvania or the cast of Hamilton.<br />\nFrom all of us here at WeSpire, we hope that you an enjoyable and relaxing Thanksgiving with family, friends and others that you appreciate having in your life.</p>\n","slug":"recognition-vs-rewards-vs-gratitude-science-says-part-ii","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"de2fc1f9-6a3a-5b6b-9149-39c15d72558a"}}}
