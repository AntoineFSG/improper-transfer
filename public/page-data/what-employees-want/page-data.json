In order to understand what programs your employees will be excited by, you need to find out what excites them, what are their individual passions and how can you align company goals and initiatives with their interests.<br />\nThe best way to get this information is to ask employees directly. Whether it be though your company&#8217;s intranet, an online forum, encouraging open discussion during team meetings, or through company-wide surveys, make sure you provide outlets for employees to share their feelings and preferences with company leaders.<br />\nWe believe that surveys are an especially useful tool to help understand your workforce. They allow you to gather qualitative and anecdotal information as well as analyze quantitative data. We&#8217;ve created a <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/qs_detailwhite_paperqs_resource_nameeeinterestsurvey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comprehensive library of questions</a> related to employee engagement programming that can be used to understand what your employees want from employee engagement programming. You can use these questions to create a standalone employee engagement interest survey, or just pick a few questions to include in an existing all-company survey. Either way, we encourage you to use this tool to get you thinking about the types of conversations your organizations should be having with employees, where you may have strengths in your programming efforts and where you may need to improve.<br />\nWhile every organization has different methods to communicate and collect information from their employee base, it is important to close the loop and be transparent in your process. Share your findings with employees, how their feedback influenced the programs you plan to implement, and why you may not be able to deliver on some ideas right away, if at all.<br />\nEmployees value being heard, and are more willing to engage if they feel a personal connection in doing so or are aware of how their efforts help their organization be more successful.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/qs_detailwhite_paperqs_resource_nameeeinterestsurvey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Empower employees&#8217; voices to be heard</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n","slug":"what-employees-want","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2f50e3d8-558b-592e-b0ed-ef6196d1faca"}}}
