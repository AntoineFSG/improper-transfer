Current employee engagement research, like the <a title=\"Deloitte Human Capital Trends 2015\" href=\"http://dupress.com/articles/employee-engagement-culture-human-capital-trends-2015/?id=gx:2el:3dc:dup1132:eng:cons:hct15\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Deloitte Human Capital Trends</a> report, finds 87% of organizations cite culture and engagement as one of their top challenges. In combination with only <a title=\"Gallup State of the Global Workplace\" href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">13%</a> of global employees being engaged in their work, employee engagement has emerged as a critical business issue.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h1>The State of Employee Engagement in Sustainability and CSR</h1>\n<p>Last year we released <a title=\"The State of Employee Engagement 2014\" href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wespire-releases-the-state-of-employee-engagement-in-sustainability-and-csr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">original employee engagement research</a> that identified sustainability and corporate social responsibility as key areas where employees want to be engaged in: 65% of employees want to know more about the sustainability efforts of their employer and coworkers &#8216; and this is even more pronounced for Millennials.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2014-survey.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-654 size-large\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2014-survey-1024x483.png\" alt=\"2014 survey\" width=\"640\" height=\"302\" /></a><br />\nIn support of this trend, we also found that employers increasingly have an employee engagement policy related to sustainability, nearly doubling from 17% in 2011 to 30% in 2014. Despite this increase, 51% of employees would like to see their employer&#8217;s stance on sustainability to change.<br />\n<em>So what can businesses do to make workplace sustainability more effective and accessible to employees?</em> One important insight from the 2014 survey is how essential the workplace is in engaging employees and how it can drive lasting behavior change. <strong>Nearly 90% of employees would try a sustainability tactic at home that was introduced at work</strong>, revealing how employee engagement programs can benefit from going beyond workplace focus to impact employee behavior and habits.</p>\n<h2>The Evolving Landscape of Employee Engagement</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Shared Purpose</strong>: Over the last year, there&#8217;s been more evidence demonstrating that employees want to feel a sense of shared purpose with their employer. Deloitte&#8217;s <a title=\"Deloitte 2015 Millennial Survey\" href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennialsurvey.html#\">2015 Millennial Survey</a> found that 77% of connected Millennials choose to work where they do because of the company&#8217;s sense of purpose. Effective employee engagement programs connect employees to the company&#8217;s mission and values, enabling employees to feel more informed and understand how their work contributes to business goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Purpose</strong>: Strong Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility programs can help businesses connect employees to their companies&#8217; social purpose, and help employees feel &#8220;ownership&#8221; of company goals. However, to make these programs, and ultimately the sense of shared purpose, most effective is the direct relationship between employees and their managers.</li>\n<li><strong>New Workplace Demographics</strong>: Employees are separated geographically and typically communicate over mobile which is creating the need for more collaborative opportunities fueled by two-way communications, direct feedback and recognition.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Predictions for 2015</h2>\n<p>Knowing that employee engagement continues to persist as a key business challenge, we want to build off of last year&#8217;s employee engagement research to better understand what businesses can do to improve these numbers. As employee engagement continues to evolve, our survey is evolving with it. Previous iterations of the survey focused primarily on employee engagement on sustainability and CSR, however this year we are broadening the scope to include more direct and indirect factors impacting employee engagement.<br />\nFrom our research and experience, we are finding that the most successful employee engagement programs incorporate a greater <a title=\"CSR + Sustainability = Behavior Change That Works\" href=\"http://www.wespire.com/csr-sustainability-behavior-change-that-works/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">variety</a> of subjects &#8216; since what inspires one employee may not be the same for another. We are expecting to see many of last year&#8217;s trends continue to persist, and our new questions should help further explain the reasoning behind these trends and identify new ones. In particular, this year we predict the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Great Managers</strong>: Evidence to support the new Gallup research around the importance of the manager relationship.</li>\n<li><strong>More Positive Outcomes</strong>: Proof that more holistic and integrated employee engagement programs yield the highest upticks in employee engagement and positive outcomes.</li>\n<li><strong>Engagement Platforms</strong>: Trends towards the adoption of technology to measurably increase the reach and impact of employee engagement programs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Be a Part of the Evolution: Take the Survey</h2>\n<p><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-706 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WeSpire-TShirt-300x258.png\" alt=\"WeSpire TShirt\" width=\"300\" height=\"258\" />To help us gain these valuable insights, <strong>we&#8217;re happy to announce that we have kicked off our annual <a title=\"WeSpire 2015 Survey Evolution of Employee Engagement\" href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/WeSpire2015EESurvey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">survey on <em>The Evolution of Employee Engagement</em></a></strong>.
