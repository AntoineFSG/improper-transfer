A <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/08/ranking-world%E2%80%99s-most-water-stressed-countries-2040\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new report</a> from the World Resources Institute describes surging demand for water&#8217;global and local; today and long-term&#8217;which is driven by complex factors like population growth, droughts, and extreme precipitation events.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nThe good news is that people are <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/droughtbusters-the-7-7-million-gallons-of-water-that-didnt-go-down-the-drain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acting and adapting</a>. In southern California, for example, recent progress is quietly astonishing, according to multiple news <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/opinion/sunday/how-california-is-winning-the-drought.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reports</a>. A big piece of this progress is attributable to new technology innovations that help easily and efficiently curb water consumption&#8217;e.g., chic new faucet designs, more water-efficient farming practices, and filling reservoirs with shade-balls to reduce evaporation.<br />\nAt WeSpire, we work with large organizations intent on harnessing the power of their employees&#8217; behavior to help on such difficult environmental and social problems.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Frequently, a super user emerges: a natural leader whose enthusiasm gives others the confidence and awareness to participate more themselves.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Say hello to <strong>Stefanie Schmidt</strong>.<br />\nStefanie is the all-time leader in the WeSpire Home Water Savers project. As we post, she has saved 144,193 gallons of water. And counting. She says it&#8217;s easy, and she loves to share water saving tips with her friends, co-workers, and the guest who she meets on the job at MGM Resorts.<br />\nStefanie works at MGM&#8217;s Dolphin Habitat at the Mirage in Las Vegas, Nevada. It&#8217;s dry in Vegas, with average rainfall less than half an inch per month. Unsurprisingly, MGM Resorts&#8217; management works hard on water conservation, and it&#8217;s paying off: they&#8217;ve saved 94 million gallons of water in the past two years.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Water conservation holds a special place in my heart. I love the oceans and want to help protect our Earth&#8217;s resources. I like the My Green Advantage app&#8217;it&#8217;s an easy way to share. I absolutely love participating. It&#8217;s so great to make others aware that they can make a difference. Simple things like taking shorter showers or watering your lawn less can really add up.<small>Stefanie Schmidt</small></p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>What can you do to reduce water consumption, starting today? </strong></h3>\n<p>We have 10 water saving tips for you, based on WeSpire user data.
