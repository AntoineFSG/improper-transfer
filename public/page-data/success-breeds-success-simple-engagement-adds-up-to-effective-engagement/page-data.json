How would you make that happen?<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nYou might improve systems and operational efficiencies across continents, as CEO Joe Kaeser of the global giant Siemens just announced, in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/opinion/industry-can-lead-on-climate-change.html\">The New York Times</a>: How does a company cut its carbon footprint in half in just five years? We&#8217;re targeting facilities, vehicles, and fuel.<br />\nHe&#8217;s wise to begin with a variety of steps: Through these steps, we hope to demonstrate to other companies that cutting your carbon footprint is not only possible, but profitable. With today&#8217;s software and technology, it&#8217;s easier than ever before to increase efficiency.<br />\nOn WeSpire&#8217;s interactive platform, users take steps to support ambitious corporate programs, and it&#8217;s no surprise that the simplest actions are often the best starters. Social scientists confirm that relatively easy initial accomplishments produce a sense of satisfaction and mastery. Participants develop awareness, begin to enjoy contributing, and are motivated to share their success with others.</p>\n<h3>Easy action leads to increased action</h3>\n<p>The top actions trending across <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/employee-engagement-platform/\">the WeSpire platform</a> right now fit this criteria. Have a look: they&#8217;re all impactful things you (and just about anyone you know) can do&#8217;if not today, then soon&#8217;and without spending a penny. When that happens, you&#8217;ll likely influence others to do the same.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Save your leftovers from one meal</li>\n<li>Turn off the lights</li>\n<li>Take a break and walk outside</li>\n<li>Review your energy bill</li>\n<li>Turn off the faucet while brushing teeth</li>\n<li>Recycle something at work today</li>\n<li>Take the stairs instead of the elevator</li>\n<li>Find a healthy recipe, and share it</li>\n<li>Close the shades to save energy one day</li>\n<li>Wait to run dishwasher until it&#8217;s full</li>\n<li>Wash a load of laundry in cold water</li>\n<li>Take 5 minutes to stretch</li>\n<li>Exercise before or after work today</li>\n<li>Eat a healthy breakfast</li>\n<li>Unplug your cellphone charger once fully charged</li>\n</ol>\n<h6>  WeSpire.com, 2015</h6>\n<blockquote><p>Social encouragement along with accessibility can improve outcomes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sociologist Arnout van de Rijt <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/28/on-privilege-and-luck-or-why-success-breeds-success/\">explains</a> the power of small, random initial advantages that can spiral into huge ones via recent experiments. His team visited four well-known websites (Kickstarter and Wikipedia among them), where they distributed small bursts of success.<br />\nThese small initial bursts proved to have an outsized effect: they started a chain reaction. For Dr. van de Rijt, original small acts are prerequisite for creating the immense momentum needed to successfully address immense challenges.<br />\nIn the scientific theories I work with, we see that most people have a threshold of zero, meaning they are immediately willing to do little things. If other people are on board, they&#8217;re willing to do even more. Then, things get interesting! The slight, early activity can ignite a chain reaction and create an entire positive revolution.<br />\nWhen you engage the first movers, they pull in others who may need a stronger push. Interest continues to build. People think, I can do it now.&#8217; Their participation leads to even more involvement, and to more, until a momentum kicks in. Eventually, even the most conservative people are in motion.<br />\n<strong>This maps a smart strategy for solving almost impossible challenges, like reducing CO2 emissions to zero.</strong><br />\nAs Siemens&#8217; CEO Joe Kaeser puts it, We have the technologies, we have the business incentive, and we have the responsibility. Now all we need is the commitment.<br />\nActive WeSpire users make a difference: not only do they consume energy more thoughtfully, they waste less, get healthy, save money, pitch in, enjoy work more, and straight-up take charge of their lives. That&#8217;s a four-way win: for people, for the planet, for the organization itself, and for others who are inspired by the activity.<br />\nThanks to the breakthrough from social scientists <em>and</em> the inspiring business leaders who are intent on prudent, profitable actions&#8217;all of whom realize the importance of human commitment for success.</p>\n","slug":"success-breeds-success-simple-engagement-adds-up-to-effective-engagement","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"0c49db3c-2b37-59c7-a8d9-dd4f75191d2d"}}}
