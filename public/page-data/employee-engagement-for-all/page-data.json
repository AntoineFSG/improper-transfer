Business services including professional and tech services along with computer systems design led the pack. There was also an uptick in jobs in the leisure and hospitality industries.<br />\nThese two industries may seem very different, but one thing they have in common is that much of their workforce does not work in a typical office environment. This means these organizations executives also share a big challenge: how do we engage employees who aren&#8217;t in the office?<br />\nOur latest white paper, <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/engaging-field-workersqs_detailwhite_paperqs_resource_namemobile_workforce/\">Employee Engagement for All</a>, tackles this problem head on. Here&#8217;s a sneak preview of the paper and four best practices for engaging non-office employees:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Think Mobile: </strong>Nearly 70 percent of U.S. adults own a smartphone, providing Human Resources professionals with a powerful channel to communicate with non-office employees. Analyze your intranet and the content available on it to make sure that it&#8217;s mobile-friendly. Emails and videos should be mobile optimized and event live company events can have a mobile component such as a livestream.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Promote Community: </strong>Company-wide events and livestreams are a great way to foster a sense of community. Company-wide recognition programs can also help to break down barriers between corporate headquarters and local offices, stores or properties.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Be Flexible: </strong>Non-office workers are often on atypical schedules, shifts or frequently traveling. In order to keep them up-to-date on company announcements and news, make sure that you provide virtual log-ins and post-event recordings. It&#8217;s important to provide employees with the opportunity to listen and learn.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Understand that One Size Does NOT Fit All: </strong>Business leaders need to be able to strike a balance between creating a unified, cohesive culture and understanding that employees in and outside of the office have different needs, desires and backgrounds. Work with leaders and managers at the field offices/stores/sites to help them develop programs that their employees will be excited about to participate in.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/engaging-field-workersqs_detailwhite_paperqs_resource_namemobile_workforce/\"><img class=\"wp-image-1818 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-04-at-12.03.10-PM-300x232.png\" alt=\"Mobile_Workforce_Whitepaper\" width=\"200\" height=\"155\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/engaging-field-workersqs_detailwhite_paperqs_resource_namemobile_workforce/\">Download our white paper</a> for more best practices and learn how Caesars Entertainment engages employees across properties, functions and departments everyday.</p></blockquote>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-for-all","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"fcc7bd20-ffa4-5692-9188-00f4c62cf7bb"}}}
