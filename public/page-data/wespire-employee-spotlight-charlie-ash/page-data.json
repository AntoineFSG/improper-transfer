At WeSpire we are extremely fortunate to have a number of amazing colleagues, all working to bring purpose to employees at companies large and small around the world.</strong><br />\n<!--more--><br />\n<strong>Every month we shine the spotlight on one member of the WeSpire team, giving you an </strong><strong>ongoing glimpse</strong><strong> into the workforce behind the most powerful employee-engagement platform on the market today.</strong><br />\n<strong>Please meet Charlie Ash, Product Designer!</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Charlie-Ash.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1502 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Charlie-Ash-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Ash\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><br />\nQ: What are the top five most-used apps on your phone?<strong> </strong><br />\n<strong>A: Spotify, Instagram, Echofon, Google Maps, Venmo</strong><br />\nQ: What do you appreciate most about your childhood?<br />\n<strong>A: First and foremost, the love and support of my parents; they encouraged me in every way and means possible. Additionally, something I never appreciated sufficiently at the time, but it was being able to grow up in such a naturally beautiful area as midcoast Maine. Being encouraged to spend time outside, to go hiking and swimming and sledding every day were opportunities I&#8217;m extremely grateful for. And I now relish every chance I can to go back!</strong><br />\nQ: Tell us about your favorite teacher/coach/adult figure growing up. Why did they inspire you then, and what have you realized about them now?<br />\n<strong>A: Charlie Seymour, my middle school band teacher. I wasn&#8217;t a huge concert band enthusiast, but he made learning and playing music fun. What I realize now about him is he wasn&#8217;t just that he was fun, but that he chose a career based on his passion; his enjoyment and dedication to his craft shone through in his teaching.</strong><br />\nQ: You have to go on vacation for two weeks, all expenses paid. Where to?<br />\n<strong>A: Either on a safari in southern Africa or backpacking through the Patagonia region of Argentina and Chile. Top two things on my global travels to-do list!</strong><br />\nQ: If you were in charge, what would you fix?<br />\n<strong>A: Simple (and maybe stereotypical): peace. C&#8217;mon people! We should encourage thoughtful dialogue around conflict, not partisan gridlock in governments and on a senseless violence amongst nations.</strong><br />\n<strong>Alternate answer: fix the countless archaic and inane rules and broken systems in professional sports.</strong><br />\nQ: What&#8217;s the best Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG) you ever heard of, and whose was it? <em>(</em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">examples</a><em>, for inspiration)</em><br />\n<strong>A: As <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wespire-employee-spotlight-andrew-borstein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andrew</a> wrote in his spotlight, Kennedy&#8217;s declaration to put a man on the moon was a pretty huge BHAG! Spending my formidable </strong><em>{editor LOL}</em><strong> years during the rise of the internet, another great example of a BHAG was Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mission</a> to organize the world&#8217;s information and make it universally accessible and useful. The whole concept of what they&#8217;ve helped create seemed incomprehensible only a short time ago!</strong><br />\nQ: When you&#8217;re at work, what&#8217;s the most interesting opportunity you have to solve a Big Hairy Audacious Problem (BHAP)?<br />\n<strong> </strong><strong>A: As a designer it&#8217;s when I&#8217;m tackling a problem that I have no pre-envisioned solution for. Diving in with no knowledge of where the project could lead is both liberating and exhilarating. Additionally, I think the whole mission of WeSpire solving a BHAP&#8217;turning a focus on employee engagement from something companies <em>could</em> have into something they <em>should</em> have.</strong><br />\nQ: When you went to college, did you have an idea of what you wanted to do?<br />\n<strong>A: None whatsoever. I majored in economics because&#8217; well, looking back, I&#8217;m not sure why. I enjoyed it, but it was a somewhat arbitrary choice. I did always have an interest in design, and a decade later finally decided to pull the trigger and pursue it (thanks </strong><a href=\"https://www.startupinstitute.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Startup Institute</strong></a><strong>!)</strong><br />\nQ: If you could hire a personal assistant tomorrow, what three questions would you ask him/or her in the job interview?<br />\n<strong>A: What interests you most about this position? What motivates you in life, both day-to-day and in the long-term? What&#8217;s your favorite thing to do on a day off?</strong><br />\nQ: What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?<br />\n<strong>A: As long as it&#8217;s in good faith and with the right company, nothing. I think it&#8217;s very important to have a good sense of humor and take nothing too seriously as long as you&#8217;re not intentionally hurting someone.</strong><br />\nQ: What&#8217;s your favorite new vocabulary word?<br />\n<strong>A: Recently I&#8217;ve learned of the word whopperjawed (essentially means askew). Been trying to use it as much as possible since!</strong><br />\nQ: What&#8217;s your favorite meal you made recently?<br />\n<strong>A: My dad worked at a restaurant while I was growing up and would often make a fantastic Caesar salad from scratch. I&#8217;m still working on perfecting it, but am getting better each time I try.</strong><br />\nQ: Signature cocktail?<br />\n<strong>A: Gin and Tonic in the summer. Whisky with an ice cube in the winter.</strong><br />\nQ: Ideal date night?<br />\n<strong> </strong><strong>A: It starts by going on a road trip, maybe to go on a short hike, listening to and singing along to bad (read: awesome) 90s music. Afterwards it would be finding a delicious hole-in-the-wall restaurant with great cocktails and a diverse beer list, and spending the evening sipping drinks, eating food, and laughing our faces off in conversation.</strong><br />\nQ: Greatest extravagance?<br />\n<strong> </strong><strong>A: Treating myself by going out to a nice dinner once a month. Working up towards making a yearly trip to start checking off my travel bucket list.</strong><br />\nQ: Ideal pet?<br />\n<strong> </strong><strong>A: A dog that&#8217;s the perfect combination of wanting to go for hikes and run around, and willing to have a lazy Sunday napping on the couch. And not make me sneeze like crazy.</strong><br />\nQ: What would constitute a perfect day for you?<br />\n<strong> </strong><strong>A: Start the morning with a cup of coffee and a crossword puzzle on the coast of Maine, listening to the surf and smelling the salt water air. The day would consist of hiking or swimming with friends and family, maybe a boat ride or kayak excursion. End it with beers around a bonfire reminiscing about old memories and creating new ones. Throw a Red Sox game somewhere into the mix, and it&#8217;s as close to perfect as I could get!</strong><br />\n<strong> </strong><strong>(Note: after completion I just saw </strong><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wespire-employee-spotlight-ellie-perkins-jowers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Ellie&#8217;s response</strong></a><strong> to this question&#8217; I&#8217;ll just say she has amazing taste.)</strong><br />\nQ: If you were to die and come back as a person or thing, what do you think it would be?<br />\n<strong>A: Probably </strong><a href=\"http://africageographic.com/blog/honey-badger-houdini/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Stoffel</strong></a><strong> the honey badger.</strong><br />\nQ: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?<br />\n<strong>A: The ability to engage in thoughtful and meaningful conversation with anyone on any topic, from quantum entanglement to which brand of seltzer water is best (Polar cranberry lime, duh).</strong><br />\nMad lib bio snapshot:<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Charlie Ash</span> was born in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Rockport, Maine</span>.
