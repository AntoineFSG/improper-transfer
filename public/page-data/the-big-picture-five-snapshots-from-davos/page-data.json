The 2016 event, The Fourth Industrial Revolution, concluded over the weekend.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\n<strong>The agenda included, well, just about everything that&#8217;s important in the world:</strong> The future of health, the future of work, the future of change. Leadership: what it takes and who can do it. Inequality&#8217;of gender, race, education, income. Food availability, security, and waste. Terrorism. Opportunities and risks posed by rapid developments in technology and science. The societal consequences of <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-risks-2016/executive-summary/\">climate change</a>. Ideas, ideas, and <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/36-best-quotes-of-davos-2016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more ideas</a>.</p>\n<h2>Here are our top five takeaways for business leaders, and we hope you&#8217;ll chime in with yours.</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Technology is a catalyst for transformative change&#8217;<em>and people make it happen</em>.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Everything is in question. So how can you get your TEAM thinking about this. The biggest limiting factor today is not the technology, it&#8217;s the humans in an organization, who are not used to questioning.   Klaus Kleinfeld, CEO, Alcoa</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Every major CEO today is very conscious of the role of technology and how it is creating a new platform of opportunity. Well-run companies anticipate this: they train their people, recruit their people, and have their culture reflect change. Some cultures are change-oriented, and some are not. That is the big variable here. Perfect example: You look at CEO Jeff Immelt, moving GE to Boston. It&#8217;s because of the culture of Boston, the talent he&#8217;ll get in Boston. People want to live and work in Boston, and GE will be able to attract those people into its workforce.   John Studzinski of the Blackstone Group <a href=\"http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000485024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on CNBC at Davos</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>Every major CEO today is very conscious of the role of technology and how it is creating a new platform of opportunity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Diversity Rules</strong>: we heard a few <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/7-quotes-on-gender-parity-from-davos-2016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">memorable comments</a> on gender equality and social injustice among attendees of the conference itself. Mark Barry of Marks &amp; Spencer described the great Achilles heel of Davos: its aged, white, male, Anglo-Saxon membership&#8217; Until that changes, it will starve itself of the broad talent, skills and knowledge that&#8217;s needed to lead a complex world. So challenge Davos for the morality of its monochrome invite list, but also more pragmatically for how this will limit economic growth and prosperity in the future, too.<br />\n<strong>3. Stop spending money on things that don&#8217;t work, but don&#8217;t stop spending money</strong>. Businesses are discovering that the costs of not doing things are becoming higher than doing things, as Unilever CEO Paul Polman said.<br />\n<strong>4. Grab easy wins:</strong> e.g., <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-surprisingly-simple-solution-to-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">switch to efficient lighting</a>, recycle, <a href=\"http://www.greenbiz.com/article/unilever-nestle-usda-rockefeller-unite-cut-food-waste\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reduce food waste</a>. A new executive coalition called <a href=\"http://champions123.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Champions 12.3</a> intends to cut food waste in half. (12.3 refers to the respective <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/\">UN Sustainable Development Goal</a>.)<br />\n<strong>5.</strong> Salesforce Founder/CEO Marc Benioff arguably cast the question with the most overarching resonance. Saturday afternoon&#8217;s tweet @Benioff:<br />\n<em>Asking myself after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Davos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@Davos</a>: <strong>Are there 10 things we can each do to incrementally transform inequality to equality?</strong> And if so, what are they?</em><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nP.S. Four thousand miles from Davos, WeSpire&#8217;s Founder/CEO offered an answer as she addressed a Harvard Business School audience on women and entrepreneurship (which was, coincidentally, picked up on <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/these-are-the-extra-challenges-female-entrepreneurs-face\">WEF.org</a>)<br />\n<strong><em>Be sure you are in love with the problem the business seeks to address. Not the product, not the service, but the problem you are solving. In the case of WeSpire,</em></strong><strong><em> it&#8217;s the problem of how do we use tech to inspire people to take positive action. How do you use technology to change behavior, and life, for the better. </em></strong></p>\n","slug":"the-big-picture-five-snapshots-from-davos","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f9adfb6e-fd42-5170-b2e8-d44b67a8d096"}}}
