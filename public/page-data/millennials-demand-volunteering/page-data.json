It was a beautiful day and allowed our team the opportunity to get outside, get active and help the community.<br />\nMore than 1,500 volunteers came out to participate in Tech Gives Back, underscoring the interest in corporate volunteer programs. Millennials in particular are demanding to work for organizations that are actively making a positive impact. The Society for Human Resources Management found that 94 percent of millennial employees are interested in using their skills to benefit a cause, and more than half desire more companywide opportunities to do so.<br />\n<img class=\"wp-image-1968 size-medium alignright\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-25-at-3.29.30-PM-300x207.png\" alt=\"TUGG\" width=\"300\" height=\"207\" /><br />\nHere are four reasons why WeSpire encourages employees to get involved in corporate volunteering:<br />\n<strong>Personal / Professional Development</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Volunteering provides opportunities to learn through new experiences, helping employees to develop skills and knowledge they wouldn&#8217;t necessarily learn in the office. It also encourages you to step outside of your comfort zone, allowing you to explore hidden talents and further develop your self confidence. Volunteering experiences are a great way to help you differentiate yourself and grow as an individual and a professional.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Support A Cause</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Volunteering is a great way to give back to your local community, for instance we worked with the Esplanade Association, a private non-profit that owns and runs The Boston Esplanade. Given their small budget and tight resources they only have two full time employees to manage the entire area, so they rely heavily on volunteers to help them get the work done. It&#8217;s always a rewarding feeling to provide a helping, especially to those who are dedicated to their organization&#8217;s mission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Networking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Volunteering gives you the opportunity to network with different people and organizations and learn more about the amazing work being done in your local community. It&#8217;s also a nice opportunity to get your organization&#8217;s name out there and get feedback and validation on the work that you are doing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Camaraderie</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Company-wide volunteer events connect with employees across different teams and departments. It&#8217;s a great way to strengthen peer relationships, hear what other teams in the organization are working on, and connect employees who are passionate about the similar causes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Planning your own company-wide volunteer event?
