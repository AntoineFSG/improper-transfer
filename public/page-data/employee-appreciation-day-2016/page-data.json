If you have a job, you work with people. You feel great when people appreciate you; today, take a minute to appreciate them! You&#8217;ll be satisfied about making the effort. It&#8217;s the right thing to do <em>and</em> it makes sound business sense: appreciated employees are more likely to be positive, engaged, high-performing, and have better retention rates.<br />\nFortunately, WeSpire released a new white paper about Rewards &amp; Recognition just last week, and you can <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/whats-in-a-thank-youqs_detailwhite_paperqs_resource_namerewards_and_recognition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">download it here</a>.<br />\n<strong>Highlights:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Honesty.</span> </strong>A hollow thank you is probably worse than no thank you at all. So please, be thoughtful and sincere. <em>Why do you want to commend this person? What is special about them?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Frequency.</strong></span> Regular people like to hear thank you&#8217; more than once in a while. Millennials: even more often&#8217;but not so much that the appreciation feels bogus (see point 1).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Power of Peers.</strong></span> People love appreciation from the boss, of course, and peer recognition is also so meaningful.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Variety.</strong></span> Instead of appreciating a top employee with a gold watch or a stock email, dream up a fun outing, or let them organize it! Tie the experience to their favorite team, star, food, interest, or cause.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This #EmployeeAppreciation day and every day, the WeSpire team is here to help you properly appreciate the people you work with. We appreciate all of you! And, we intend to support you and your colleagues for your most important, meaningful work.<br />\nPlease <u><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">let us know</a></u> if we can be helpful.
