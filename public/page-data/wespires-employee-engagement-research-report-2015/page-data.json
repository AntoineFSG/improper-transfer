For <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WeSpire</a>, that means we&#8217;re constantly exploring and researching how that affects the forward-thinking, global organizations we work with, along with the employees at the heart of these brands who use our platform. To that end, WeSpire is proud to announce the release of our new report, <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/evolution-of-employee-engagement-research-2015/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Evolution of Employee Engagement</a>.<br />\nWith the problem of employee disengagement reaching critical levels, the survey aims to shed light on the direct and indirect factors impacting employee engagement across organizations including the role of the manager, corporate transparency, and employee choice and collaboration. This annual survey highlights how employee engagement is changing today&#8217;s corporate environment and what employers can do to engage workers, implement business-focused initiatives and drive positive impact across volunteering, corporate responsibility, well-being and sustainability.<br />\nThe data clearly demonstrates that millennials &#8216; the future of our workforce &#8216; place the highest value on employee engagement. In fact, an overwhelming 76% of employees under the age of 30 want to see their employer do more around employee engagement. And, while 50% of survey respondents said they were interested in becoming more involved in their organization&#8217;s volunteer, sustainability, well-being or social responsibility programs, 71% of employees under the age of 30 expressed a desire to be more involved.<br />\nThe survey also revealed three key trends for more successful employee engagement initiatives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Great Managers</strong>: Managers are a critical component to employee engagement. Eighty-nine percent of very engaged employees say their superiors care about them, while only 28% of not at all engaged employees answered positively. Beyond that, 97% of very engaged employees said they&#8217;re making meaningful contributions to their organization.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Transparency between management and employees results in a more engaged workforce. Specifically, in organizations with official employee engagement policies, 55% of workers are engaged, while only 40% of employees are engaged at organizations without official policies.</li>\n<li><strong>Choice and Collaboration</strong>: Workers who have a choice in the types of programs they can positively impact or have the ability to collaborate on company outreach activities are more likely to be engaged. In addition, peer collaboration is becoming increasingly more important, with 62% of respondents being interested in learning more about the sustainability efforts of their co-workers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear that employee engagement and corporate culture have become top-level business priorities for senior management, and there is no arguing that an engaged workforce is a higher performing one, but the disconnect between intent and execution across organizations is widespread. We hope the findings in our survey will help companies tackle the problem of engagement and use those initiatives to drive, long-term positive impact.<br />\nA full copy of The Evolution of Employee Engagement can be downloaded on the WeSpire <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/evolution-of-employee-engagement-research-2015/\">website</a>.
