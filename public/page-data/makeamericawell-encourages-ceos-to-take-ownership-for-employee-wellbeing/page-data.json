America’s employees are not particularly healthy, it’s costing everyone a lot of money [$3.4T was spent on healthcare], and people need help and support to improve fitness, eat healthy and reduce stress which contributes to 75% of the expense. The </span><a href=\"https://www.mindbodyonline.com/make-america-well\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#MakeAmericaWell challenge</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> encourages business leaders to commit to investing more in employee wellness.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Mindbody doesn’t offer employee wellbeing solutions to corporations directly and Stollmeyer wanted to offer a solution for those leaders who took the challenge and needed one. We were so proud when MindBody decided to include a reference to <a href=\"https://www.wespire.com\">WeSpire</a> in the challenge &#8211; and highlight our increased investment in wellbeing programs and our revolutionary behavior change platform. This way, leaders who want to invest more in wellbeing but are struggling to implement a program have at least one option right in front of them. </span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;At MINDBODY, our purpose is to help people lead healthier, happier lives by connecting the world to wellness. <a href=\"https://www.wespire.com\">WeSpire</a> provides an employee wellness solution that allows corporations with a technology platform to design, run and measure the impact of their employee engagement initiatives.These programs encourage employees to take actions that are good for them, good for the company and good for the world we live in.&#8221; said Amanda Patterson, VP of Corporate &amp; Brand Marketing of Mindbody. </span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you think your company’s leadership should increase their commitment to employee wellbeing, encourage them to take the <a href=\"https://www.mindbodyonline.com/make-america-well\">#MakeAmericaWell challenge</a>.
