However, I believe there is a deeper meaning and connection, that few people are noticing and it’s called apocalypse.<br />\nThe word does not mean the end of the world, but an uncovering or revelation. And what is that revelation? I believe the natural disasters we are experiencing should be viewed as a wake-up call that there needs to be a shift in mass consciousness.<br />\nWhat is mass consciousness? According to Gloria Excelsias, president of an educational platform with focus on psychological and spiritual development, it’s the consciousness of the masses. And unfortunately, it isn&#8217;t positive. It means being led by your subconscious mind, living on automatic pilot, not owning one&#8217;s power, not loving one&#8217;s self, and attacking others for lack of self-worth and personal power. How many people do you know who are actually in control of their minds, feelings, emotions and lower-self desires? The majority of people are not and because we are all connected, it&#8217;s having a negative impact on everyone.<br />\nHow does this show up in the workplace? Lack of leadership, Corporate greed, decisions made based on ego and out of fear, clinging to the status quo and an unwillingness to change, people throwing one another under the bus instead of taking personal accountability, etc. And what is the byproduct of this? Dysfunctional cultures and disengaged workers.</p>\n<h3><strong>BE AWESOME!</strong></h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to begin the journey out of mass consciousness, Excelsias offers a few tips:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Own your personal power and be assertive.</li>\n<li>Become completely whole within yourself so you don&#8217;t look externally to fill a perceived emptiness inside of you.</li>\n<li>Be vigilant for love and against fear.</li>\n<li>Understand that Earth is a school which you graduate from by learning to move out of mass consciousness.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Are the multiple turbulent weather events linked to global warming? Most likely. But I choose to believe that they seek to serve a greater purpose: the revelation that what we&#8217;re doing and how we&#8217;re being isn&#8217;t working. There&#8217;s a better way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://www.jillchristensenintl.com/\"><i>Jill Christensen</i></a></span><span class=\"s2\"><i> is an employee engagement expert, best-selling author, and international keynote speaker.
