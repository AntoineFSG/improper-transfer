Information-sharing from traditional forms of top-down communication no longer works. Organizations need to identify their top influencers&#8217;the go-to people&#8217; for employees to get honest answers and information from. These people could be the most vocal employees&#8217;either an asset or liability to the organization&#8217;therefore why not tap into them to get them to help you achieve something positive? Identify influencers by snowball sampling survey techniques. Ask employees, Who do you trust? Then use those people mentioned most often to help you co-create and promote strategy.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.greenbiz.com/article/GreenBiz-Forum-15-McDonalds-Target-Walmart-corporate-sustainability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The 3 Biggest Takeaways from GreenBiz Forum 15</a></h3>\n<p>We were proud to have our CEO &amp; Founder, Susan Hunt Stevens, speak <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150218005134/en/WeSpire%E2%80%99s-Susan-Hunt-Stevens-Present-Employee-Engagement#.VOeyrilDZVs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">twice</a> during the GreenBiz Forum this week.
