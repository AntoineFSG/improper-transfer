Specifically, the problem of the increasing rate of distraction and multitasking in the workplace is wreaking havoc with the ability to focus on strategic initiatives. Employees are being hijacked by notifications, task switching and the overwhelming temptation to multitask anytime, anyplace and on any device.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h1>The Challenges of the Always-On &amp; Connected Workplace</h1>\n<p>The impact of our increasingly mobile and dispersed workforce (Gartner estimates 75% of project work is now done by distributed, virtual teams) makes it even harder for co-workers to gain visibility into core company initiatives and collectively participate in making positive impact. Gallup identifies these as two core challenges for remote and mobile workers.<br />\nChanging the unhealthy habits of distraction requires an understanding and calculated execution of human behavior techniques combined with information delivery that is relevant and engaging. Forging new habits is the new mandate for successful employee engagement platforms and the methodology for designing habit-forming solutions is derived from the art&#8217;and science&#8217;of behavior engineering.</p>\n<h2>The Way We&#8217;re Working Isn&#8217;t Working</h2>\n<p>What&#8217;s not working for employees? Besides the fact that employees find it increasingly difficult to accomplish important and impactful work (amid all the distractions), they also don&#8217;t feel appreciated and have no idea or proof that what they&#8217;re doing contributes to bottom line results. Outside of work, employee despondency increases when they&#8217;re having to attend to more communications that aren&#8217;t relevant or enlightening. This experience is not unique to anyone in an organization&#8217;it&#8217;s common with middle managers and top executives, too.<br />\nWhen employees feel that four basic needs are met (physical/well-being, emotional/recognition, mental/impact and spiritual/higher purpose), they are more fulfilled and engaged. The simplest way for companies to take on this challenge is to begin with a basic question: What would make our employees feel more energized, better taken care of, more focused and more inspired?</p>\n<h2>Finding the Love of Work</h2>\n<p>When the focus is to improve users&#8217; lives in a way that&#8217;s intuitive and beneficial (learning about opportunities to volunteer locally for causes that you personally identify with, or learn about ways to be more sustainable at work and participate with others to achieve goals, etc.) behavioral science applied to technology makes it all possible.<br />\nThe WeSpire Behavioral Project Library (BPL) motivates employees to change habits and focus on company initiatives that matter and benefit the greater community using triggers such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relevant Timing</strong>: content is delivered when an employee perceives a need that they can personally identify with</li>\n<li><strong>Actionable Content</strong>: content is simple, focused and instructs the user how to take action</li>\n<li><strong>Variety &amp; Intrigue</strong>: employees are prompted with intended actions that are enticing and elicit curiosity</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong>: WeSpire&#8217;s BPL provides businesses with best-in-class projects in the four categories that matter most to employees and a company&#8217;s bottom line: Sustainability, Corporate Citizenship, Well-Being and Volunteering. Employee engagement programs are as strong as the content that powers them, and each project in the WeSpire BPL contains robust and personalized content targeted directly to employees. When they can connect with things that matter to them and with their peers, they are happier and focused on what matters.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><img class=\" alignleft wp-image-279\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BPL_FactSheetSnapShot.png\" alt=\"WeSpire Behavioral Project Library Fact Sheet\" width=\"125\" height=\"167\" />Download WeSpire&#8217;s fact sheet <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ProjectLibraryFactSheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WeSpire&#8217;s Behavioral Project Library Fact Sheet</a> to learn more the power of behavior change in the workplace.</em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"behavior-change","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"89a065c3-13ff-5333-b26b-86488ff5fa5a"}}}
