He then made 2/3 of the room sit down. Denholm told us the remaining 1/3 represented farmland. He then made all but one person sit down. That one person represented the amount of certified organic farmland in the US. It was powerful.<br />\nKashi is one of the few certified organic breakfast cereals, and the demand for organics is growing. The bad news is there isn&#8217;t enough organic supply to fuel the demand. Denholm explained that the major barrier for farmers is that to become certified organic, in addition to having to follow ALL the rules and regulations set forth regarding organic growing methods, the land has to go unused for three years. Which means three years of NO income.<br />\nNow this is where corporate innovation, fueled by sustainability needs can have a huge impact. Corporations can solve a big market problem and in the process create a great opportunity. <a href=\"http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/supply_chain/sustainable_brands/kashi_launches_scheme_help_reward_incentivize_transit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kashi worked with Quality Assurance International</a> to create a standard that met farmers and regulators in the middle &#8216; called Certified Transitional. The Certification is open to any farmer for any crop, and any company, not just Kellogg&#8217;s brands, can label products with it. Kashi has already started using Certified Transitional crops in one of its cereals, and has plans to expand to more.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The health of people and the health of our planet are inextricably linked, David Denholm, CEO at <em>Kashi</em>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One percent organic acreage is just not enough &#8216; and we want to promote solutions that benefit everyone working to move organic farming forward. We believe championing farms in transition will make organic foods more accessible and support a more sustainable food system &#8216; for all of us.<br />\nWe applaud the work that David and his team at Kashi are doing. Their use of sustainable innovation has enabled farmers to adapt, educate their consumers, and have a positive impact on society.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/employee-engagement-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WeSpire</a> helps companies inspire people to engage in positive impact initiatives, ultimately helping companies to innovate and outperform.
