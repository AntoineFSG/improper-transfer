The culture was very different, and in hindsight, it gave me perspective.<br />\n<strong>Madison:</strong> <strong>Tell us about your favorite teacher/coach/adult figure growing up. Why did they inspire you then, and what have you realized about them now?</strong><br />\nGong Ke: I really appreciated my math teacher in High School. When I started HS I had just recently moved to the states and was just starting to learn how to speak English. I did well in math because it didn&#8217;t require a lot of English and I was good at figuring out what the problem was actually asking. My math teacher encouraged me to join our school&#8217;s math team, which was a great group of people to hang out with for my social life and language learning. The math team was my primary place for social interaction and was a huge influence on me getting into engineering and MIT. My math teacher also helped me bridge the gap between cultures and even helped me apply to colleges.<br />\n<strong>Madison:</strong> <strong>You have to go on vacation for two weeks, all expenses paid. Where to?</strong><br />\nGong Ke: I&#8217;d go to Hawaii with my husband. I love the beach and nature, and I&#8217;ve heard Hawaii has awesome fish and reefs to explore. It&#8217;s mostly about where I haven&#8217;t been yet. If I get the chance to go to Hawaii you&#8217;ll have to ask me this again, because my answer will have changed!<br />\n<strong>Madison: What&#8217;s the best Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG) you ever heard of, and whose was it? </strong><em><strong>(</strong></em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal\"><em><strong>examples</strong></em></a><em><strong>, for inspiration)</strong></em><br />\nGong Ke: <a href=\"https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKWHA-032.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JFK&#8217;s speech</a> about going to the moon was pretty awesome. It set off an entire series of events.<br />\n<strong>Madison:</strong> <strong>What word is top of mind recently?</strong><br />\nGong Ke: Internationalization.<br />\n<strong>Madison:</strong> <strong>What&#8217;s your favorite meal you ate recently?</strong><br />\nGong Ke: I like meals that you get to make part of, which was a Chinese hot pot meal in different broths.<br />\n<strong>Madison: Signature Dessert?</strong><br />\nGong Ke: Ice cream, with chocolate mocha, is one of my favorites. My childhood favorite was shaved ice with red beans covered in sweetened condensed milk!<br />\n<strong>Madison: What would constitute a perfect day for you?</strong><br />\nGong Ke: It&#8217;s hard to have everything fit into a day. But my perfect day would involve being outside, running, biking, or gardening, hanging out with my family for a bit and doing something that I care about for a bit which would be work.<br />\n<strong>Madison: That sounds pretty attainable!</strong><br />\nGong Ke: Yeah, every day is a perfect day!<br />\n<strong> Madison: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?</strong><br />\nGong Ke: Tele-transportation, I could be anywhere I want in an instant.<br />\n<strong>Madison:</strong> <strong>Favorite thing about working at WeSpire, so far?</strong><br />\nGong Ke: People are genuinely excited to make a difference at the company and through the product we build. I can really see how much thought everyone puts into their work, especially the engineers. They are all willing to welcome a good challenge if they see the value in it, then they always go above and beyond.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Gong Ke was born in <u>Shanghai, China.</u> She launched his career at WeSpire <u>just over one month ago.</u> Her favorite managers always encouraged her to <u>listen.</u> She joined WeSpire because <u>of the impact she could make and the learnings she could have</u>.
