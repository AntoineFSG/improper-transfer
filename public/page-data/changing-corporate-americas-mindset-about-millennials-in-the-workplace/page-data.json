The second conversation, a lunch featuring the president of Zipcar, the founding CEO of JUST, and the President of Diversey Care, part of Sealed Air, discussed the latest data and trends around Millennials in the workplace.<!--more-->Ironically, there were only four Millennials in the room, but both Zipcar and Sealed Air presented great data that showed some of the major differences in expectations of employers and brands between Millennials and other generations.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;More than one-in-three American workers today are Millennials (adults ages 18 to 34 in 2015), and this year they surpassed Generation X to become the largest share of the American workforce.&#8221; &#8216;<em><a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/11/millennials-surpass-gen-xers-as-the-largest-generation-in-u-s-labor-force/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Pew Research Center</a></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The data presented mirrors much of the <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/evolution-of-employee-engagement-research-2015/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research</a> that WeSpire has done over the past few years, which shows that 71% of Millennials are interested in becoming more involved in their company&#8217;s volunteer, sustainability, well-being or social responsibility initiatives, versus only 47% of workers between the ages 40-49 (the average age of US workers is <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cps/industry_age.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">42.4</a>).<br />\nWe also found that 76% of Millennials would like to see their employer change their stance on employee engagement overall. When you combine this with the fact that as a group, Millennials are also the most <a href=\"http://www.aon.com/attachments/human-capital-consulting/2014-trends-in-global-employee-engagement-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disengaged</a> workforce population, there&#8217;s enough evidence suggesting that Millennials are not just going to prefer changes in the workplace, they will likely demand it.</p>\n<h3>Ignoring or embracing reality</h3>\n<p>Whether corporations are ready to acknowledge that this generation is different or not remains to be seen. According to the people in the room at Fortune Brainstorm E, there seemed to be a split among the executives in attendance. Several stressed that no, this group is <em>truly</em> different and others argued that this new generation is no different now than the boomers were in the sixties and that as soon as millennials have mortgages and added responsibilities, their attitudes will change.<br />\nI happen to side with those that feel this generation is <strong>truly different</strong> for a number of reasons. Most notably, the Millennial generation displays unprecedented global interconnectedness; they&#8217;ve been exposed to interminable efforts by parents and schools to engage them early and frequently in volunteering, citizenship, and service; and most importantly, there is a growing belief&#8217;supported by data&#8217;that they actually ARE changing the world for the better.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Millennials are also charitable and keen to participate in &#8216;public life:&#8217; 63% give to charities, 43% actively volunteered or were a member of a community organization, and 52% signed petitions.&#8221; &#8211; <em><a href=\"http://www2.deloitte.com/al/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/2014-millennial-survey-positive-impact.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2014 Deloitte Millennial Survey</a></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>What then, can the business world learn from this new &#8220;force to be reckoned with?&#8221; Towards the end of the lunch, the group discussed research from Zipcar that shows the Millennial mindset is also found among tech-enabled, urban dwellers who happen to be Gen Xers and BabyBoomers&#8217;interesting. This suggests that the revolutionary mentality and values of this influential generation has the opportunity to spill over to other generations of workers. I think this bodes well for a true movement demanding that <strong>purpose</strong> and <strong>positive impact</strong> be a fundamental aspect of corporations and the way they&#8217;re managed.<br />\nNow, that&#8217;s a future of business I can be excited about.</p>\n","slug":"changing-corporate-americas-mindset-about-millennials-in-the-workplace","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"fe0948fe-a9c9-5ac6-b7a6-87e4380c9eb2"}}}
