He believes that over the course of the year, technology will prove that <a href=\"http://blog.wespire.com/5-ways-to-use-game-mechanics-in-employee-engagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gamification</a> is less about hype and more about productivity. Four predictions of what gamification in the workplace will look like in 2015 include 1) Employee focus, 2) The Holistic Corporation, 3) Self-serve Solutions, and 4) Integrated Analytics.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/02/02/daily-circuit-corporations-going-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why corporations &#8216;go green&#8217; ahead of regulation, public policy.</a></h3>\n<p>Andersen Corp. has announced plans to achieve a reduction of solid waste, energy and water usage by 20% by 2020.

His answer, although rather taboo at first, is love. He defends it with research from some of the top psychology professionals in the country and explains, The love I&#8217;m speaking of relates to the experience of positive emotions&#8217;the foundation of human motivation. Research suggests people need frequent exposure to these positive emotions every day, therefore workplaces must provide positive situations in order to have an impact on feelings of engagement, loyalty and love of work. His advice to leaders? Love your people.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2015/02/03/20768/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Five Trends Driving Workplace Diversity in 2015</a></h3>\n<p>Diversity is <a href=\"http://www.triplepundit.com/2015/01/whats-next-cr-thoughts-predictions-2015/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">predicted</a> to be one of the top priorities for corporate responsibility agendas this year, and corporate diversity programs have never been so visible. This is encouraging since last year Deloitte reported that Diversity/Inclusion was one of the least important issues on leaders&#8217; minds compared to other HR issues. The author, a diversity consultant, believes the added focus in 2015 is because more CEOs are piping up, semantics aren&#8217;t so subtle anymore, and diversity&#8217;s definition has changed.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/business/energy-environment/climate-changes-bottom-line.html?ref=business&amp;_r=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Climate Change&#8217;s Bottom Line</a></h3>\n<p>A detailed account of the Risky Business Project, an unusual network of business and policy leaders determined to prepare American companies&#8217;particularly agricultural companies&#8217;for climate change. The group has commissioned studies to inform business leaders on climate change because they believe it could be potentially devastating to the business world if not properly dealt with. Their focus is to educate, encourage leaders and companies to embrace adaptation, and gradually prepare agribusiness for change.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\"  wp-image-335 alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire blog image\" width=\"175\" height=\"62\" /></a><a title=\"blog\" href=\"/blog\">Visit the WeSpire blog</a> and subscribe to get the latest employee engagement articles delivered straight into your inbox.</em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-weekly-news-roundup-292015","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"aa6db1a7-93df-575d-80cf-d6309e10c168"}}}
