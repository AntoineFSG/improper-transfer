For example, spending time and money on employee well-being has proven very effective for businesses as well as employees. This article shares the reasoning from major companies such as Levi Strauss, Aetna, and Charles Schwab: when employees feel respected and are treated well, they have a deeper connection with their company and as a result find the work that they do much more meaningful. When employees have a sense of purpose, research has shown they are more productive, go above and beyond, and make significant contributions to the overall success of their organization. At the recent Fortune Global Forum, Walt Bettinger, CEO of Charles Schwab summed it up by saying, the lesson I&#8217;ve carried with me for the past 35 years: <strong>It&#8217;s not about being served.
