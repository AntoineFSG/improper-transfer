These people are frequently called upon to collaborate or help out. However, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload\">research from HBR</a> says that those seen as the best sources of information and in highest demand as collaborators in their companies tend to have the lowest employee engagement and career satisfaction scores.<br />\nHere are three ways to foster collaboration in the workplace while avoiding employee burnout.<br />\n<strong>Empower top collaborators to support a cause that&#8217;s meaningful to them. </strong>Your top collaborators are often admired and well-connected within your business.

Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Foster independence</strong>. Collaboration can bring fresh perspectives and creativity, but the reality is that not everything needs multiple hands and minds involved. Identify the tasks that can be executed independently, and once the employees in charge of these tasks gain your trust, instill autonomy in them so that they don&#8217;t feel they need to have other people helping to complete the task.<br />\n<em>How do you avoid workplace burnout? </em></p>\n","slug":"how-to-avoid-collaboration-burnout-in-the-workplace","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"ef800840-a257-54be-936b-1f1b67edc3c2"}}}
