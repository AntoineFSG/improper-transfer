In fact, employees report company culture is just as important as the job itself. Gone are the days of your posters and traditional, top-down management communication methods to create a culture of purpose and well-being. Today, you need to create an environment that supports purpose-filled work over a shared mission that&#8217;s meaningful, called &#8217;employee-led corporate philanthropy&#8217;.<br />\n<!--more-->And it pays to invest in employee sentiment. According to Glassdoor Research, Does Company Culture Pay Off?, the lack of a purposeful corporate culture is a significant factor that investors are using to determine the health and amount of risk that may be associated with a company&#8217;s financial future. The research explores the trends and correlations between company culture and stock performance of public companies.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Like any financial asset, a satisfied and engaged workforce is a highly valuable attribute of companies.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Culture Culprit</h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t want to lose your best people? Turns out it&#8217;s a leadership issue according to relationship consulting expert, Robert Hall. The old methods of leadership are failing us and the impact of poor management is costing organizations at crisis levels&#8217;unprecented low rates of employee recruitment, retention, customer loyalty, and productivity. The 2015 Human Capital Trends report from Deloitte has placed employee engagement as the No. 1 business challenge puts leadership as the No. 2 challenge, with the leadership capability gap widened in every region of the world last year.<br />\nHall&#8217;s recommendation? Become an organization that subscribes to Relational Leadership, which emphasizes three areas: priority, purpose and power. The link between shareholder value, positive employees and loyal customer relationships is real.  There&#8217;s no way around it either. Employees must be more empowered to be involved in the decisions of their organizations and the best way is through their companies&#8217; corporate philanthropy focus and management.</p>\n<h3>Strategize on Culture</h3>\n<p>So how do you know whether your corporate culture resonates with your people? According to Gallup, only one in five employees trust business leaders to tell the truth on difficult issues. Since culture deals with the attitudes, perceptions and behaviors that are promoted within an organization, then the alignment of culture with the firm strategy is imperative to firm success. But no culture is static. It is continually reinforced and balanced by internal and external events that drive the organization.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start with Managers</strong>: Ensure that every function within the organization is empowered to act on purpose-filled initiatives and understands the relationship between positive action and a strong employer brand. More importantly, nurture the relationship between supervisor and employee because when employees know that they are valued personally professionally, they understand that the work they do matters.</li>\n<li><strong>Define a Corporate Culture</strong>: Define how you&#8217;d like to be seen as an employer based on a realistic assessment of your distinctive strengths, values and commitment to investing in your community (internal and external). Translate this into a clear and compelling Employee Value Proposition.</li>\n<li><strong>Invest in Technology</strong>: The rise of social media and gamification has set the standard for communication moving away from packaged messaging to word of mouth. Millennials come to know your brand and expect a level of transparency for them to trust a company (based on what its employees have to say than on its recruitment advertising) which means that your culture will thrive if it has a technology platform that supports engagement.</li>\n<li><strong>Measure &amp; Report on the Impact</strong>: valuate your current employer brand awareness and reputation, through survey research among your key external target audiences and compare that to levels of internal employee engagement.</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage A Strong Culture for a Competitive Advantage</strong>: Be proactive in using social media to share inside stories that highlight your strengths and build a more authentic and engaging employer brand reputation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Commit to Closing the Culture Gap</h3>\n<p>Consistently, Gallup&#8217;s annual reports on employee engagement demonstrate that engaged employees give approximately 57% more effort and are 87% less likely to resign. When you commit to improving your organization&#8217;s engagement, you can expect in increase in earnings per share by as much as 147%.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When both customer and employee engagement are above average, they experience <strong>a 240% jump in performance-related business outcomes</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Human, not financial, capital must be the starting point and ongoing foundation of a successful employee engagement strategy. There are significant advantages when companies encourage open and transparent communication&#8217;knowing that it&#8217;s critical to break down barriers to honest feedback. Employer reputations will ultimately depend on the consistent values and vitality of their organizational cultures.</p>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-corporate-culture","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"4bf4ee23-ab30-5d5d-8fc6-fedad34a0817"}}}
