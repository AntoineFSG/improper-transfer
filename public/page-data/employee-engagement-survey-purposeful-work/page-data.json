Except that today organizations are facing their lowest levels of engagement and it&#8217;s affecting recruitment, productivity and retention. Creating an environment where the modern workplace can thrive requires a much more holistic, integrated, and real-time approach to measuring and driving high levels of employee commitment and passion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Business leaders are struggling to build a compelling work environment and the annual engagement survey has not kept up. Innovative solutions that enable open conversations about the workplace have the potential to disrupt traditional HR solutions and unleash a new era of real-time feedback that will help HR and business leaders dramatically improve the workplace for employees at all levels.<br />\n&#8216;J<em>osh Bersin, Principal, Deloitte Consulting LLP</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>And it&#8217;s urgent&#8230; In Deloitte&#8217;s Global Human Capital Trends research, <strong>78% of business leaders rate retention and engagement urgent or important</strong>. HR leaders are struggling to build an inclusive, passionate, multi-generational teams. They also know that engaging employees is a competitive differentiator in business both in attracting and retaining talent. But how can HR leaders move beyond the traditional and one-sided approach of diagnosis knowing it&#8217;s just not detailed enough, it isn&#8217;t real-time, and it doesn&#8217;t consider all the work related issues which drive employee commitment?</p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s the Manager, Stupid</h3>\n<p>We now know that over <strong>70% of the variance in engagement correlates to the manager</strong> (source: Gallup Business Journal, April 8, 2015). Clear and simple, it&#8217;s your boss that can turn the proverbial knobs of engagement. And they can be armed with a new breed of <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/manager-impact-on-employee-engagement/\">engagement platforms and models</a> that are beginning to emerge&#8217;focused on building the modern workforce on the foundation of purposeful work&#8217;changing their behaviors to build a culture of trust and make their employees happy.<br />\nPurposeful work comes in the form of corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainability, volunteering and well-being programs that offer actionable solutions to specific social problems in and out of the workplace and a shift in these values makes a real difference financially. A report by the Harvard Business Review pointed out that there is a strong link between <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2006/12/strategy-and-society-the-link-between-competitive-advantage-and-corporate-social-responsibility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CSR programs and profitability</a>: CSR can be much more than a cost, a constraint, or a charitable deed&#8217;it can be a source of opportunity, innovation, and competitive advantage.<br />\nFrom an HR standpoint, when managers can align themselves behind programs that help employees feel more engaged and more aligned with the company&#8217;s mission, vision, and values, it can translate into revenue. In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/april-2009/corporate-social-responsibility-can-be-profitable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">US Federal Reserve</a> found that three out of four (74 percent) of the highest revenue companies in the US now have CSR programs. Globally, the percentage of CSR reporting organizations rose to 80 percent of the world&#8217;s largest corporations. More importantly, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/causeintegration/2011/11/01/employee-engagement-and-corporate-social-responsibility-for-generation-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forbes</a> reports that the C-suite is beginning to realize that employees expect to direct their own involvement in their giving and volunteering.<br />\nPaul Zak at the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies says that workers perform best when they&#8217;re in a high-trust environment. Evaluating over 5,000 employees in 50 companies, his studies have found that <strong>those in high-trust situations with their managers are 19% more productive than those in low-trust workplaces</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Aspects to Building Trust</h3>\n<p>Turns out there are fundamental aspects in building trust and one of them is having autonomy at work or the freedom to take on projects the way you choose to.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>AUTONOMY. Without employee autonomy, they feel a lose of control&#8217;which creates stress and can affect job performance.<br />\nGreat managers know that they motivate employees when they&#8217;re in teaching instead of telling mode so they they can leverage new ideas.</li>\n<li>DIRECTION. Employees thrive on direction but should also have the freedom to choose how they work within the direction. Good direction provides a framework and toolset that can be leveraged so the employee feels capable and supported. Great managers set high standards but also provide detailed support, coaching, feedback and recognition. The <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">most engaged employees understand what&#8217;s expected from them and put into a position that leverages their strengths to succeed. </span></li>\n<li>ALIGN WITH MISSION. Managers that understand how to evolve the workplace and the roles within it can dial in engagement when help employees understand how they&#8217;re part of something bigger than themselves and how they affect the bottom line.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote><p>High-trust companies, Joe Reiman says, boast 70% greater job satisfaction and 69% higher job retention than low-trust ones. In the end, a manager&#8217;s role is to find that sweet spot.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Find the with Love within Leadership</h3>\n<p>There are two ways to lead an organization, both of which are effective motivators&#8217;at least initially.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>FEAR. Fear relies on meeting the need for safety. The trouble is, people acclimate to fear quickly, and so you have to continually amp it up to get the same response so fear loses its impact over time and people develop what psychologists call learned helplessness. Moreover, fear is an especially poor tactic when it comes to managing today&#8217;s knowledge workers. In anything that has to do with knowledge, Peter Drucker pointed out, fear will produce only resistance.</li>\n<li>LOVE. Love, on the other hand, works in exactly the opposite way. The human brain is wired for love and activated by positive social interactions between people and unites them to work towards a common purpose. Research shows that when managers create a caring and trusting workplace, employees are more likely to engaged.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Cultivate Happiness into Company Culture</h3>\n<p>Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos.com designed a happy culture and it was so successful he developed a three-day culture boot camp for the C-suite to happify&#8217; their organizations. What did Zappos.com gain?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Purposeful work builds trust and love</em>. When managers engage in activities that build trust, they also develop of strong sense of corporate purpose and therefore organizational happiness.</li>\n<li><em>Happiness increases productivity</em>. Happiness lowers stress and when employees are more joyful, they are more productive.</li>\n<li><em>Less pressure results in greater innovation</em>. People who are closer to their colleagues work more effectively together and therefore have the potential for being more innovative solutions to problems.</li>\n<li><em>Happiness on the job carries over outside of work</em>. Joy at work generally translates into happiness at home as well and HR leaders can go a long way hiring talent with good personality traits to foster it&#8217;and cultivating it at work as a response to their organization&#8217;s culture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, employees who work in high trust organizations with managers report being more competent at work. They also want to spend their entire career at their present company, are apt to recommend that family and friends get jobs there, and are apt to invest in the company&#8217;s stock. Extending trust is a key way to engage and invest employees in the company&#8217;s mission.</p>\n<h3>Leverage the 5 Levers of Driving Purposeful Work</h3>\n<p>These concepts are the foundation in Aaron Hurst&#8217;s book, <em>The Purpose Economy</em>, which documents the evolution of the American economy from its origins to where it is routinely described today as being &#8220;information-driven.&#8221; Hurst purports that we are transcending beyond just financial wealth as a measure of success to one that is driven by people&#8217;s sense of purpose. Purpose is incorporated into the workplace utilizing the following five levers:<br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_1001\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1001\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PurposefulWorkImage.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1001\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PurposefulWorkImage-940x1024.png\" alt=\"The Purpose Economy - The Five Levers of Engagement\" width=\"640\" height=\"697\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1001\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Purpose Economy &#8211; The Five Levers of Engagement</figcaption></figure></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Overcome the limitations of employee engagement surveys through purposeful work <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/goodmanagers?src=hash\">#goodmanagers</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/so6pmxdfld\">http://t.co/so6pmxdfld</a></p>\n<p>&#8216; WeSpire (@goWeSpire) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goWeSpire/status/614109657112690689\">June 25, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br />\nLike Steve Ells, the groundbreaking founder and co-CEO of Chipotle, who has focused his company on sustainably sourced &#8220;food with integrity,&#8221; purpose centers on serving needs greater than one&#8217;s own as well as enabling personal growth and building community.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-survey-purposeful-work","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"72e36c46-5db5-5323-9ee7-2cd00aafff69"}}}
