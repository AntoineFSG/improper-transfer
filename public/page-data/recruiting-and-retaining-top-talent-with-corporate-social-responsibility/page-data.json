We&#8217;ve heard the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to the more than 80 million people in this generation. Although the many, and sometimes conflicting, reports can be overwhelming, the desire to learn about this generation is well founded. They are the largest generational cohort in U.S. history and have surpassed Gen Xers as the largest generation in the U.S. labor force.<br />\nHowever, in recent conversations with leaders and employees from companies across a variety of industries, we&#8217;ve heard that <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/business-leaders-discuss-millennials-impact-in-the-workplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generations beyond just millennials are valuing the CSR efforts</a> of their organizations.

Engagement</strong><br />\nThe more input you have from your employees, the more likely you are to engage them in your programs and boost participation. As people get involved, share their experiences and recruit coworkers to participate in your CSR programs, they become ingrained in company culture.<br />\nBeing able to show that your organization&#8217;s CSR efforts are front and center when it comes to defining your company culture can be a huge draw to potential employees.<br />\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">3. Measurement</strong><br />\nOf course, it&#8217;s one thing to say that CSR is important to your company, it&#8217;s another thing to show it.
