First piloted as an in-person event in San Francisco, NewCo has evolved to include <a href=\"https://newco.co/festivals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">city-specific festivals</a> around the world, as well as a variety of digital publications.<br />\nWe were excited to participate in Boston&#8217;s NewCo festival for the second year in a row, along with 88 other mission-driven, Boston companies. In our session, we shared our proprietary framework for creating successful and engaging positive impact programs, called the <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/4-cs-positive-impact-programs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Four C&#8217;s Framework</a>.<br />\nWe shared this framework at <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/evaluating-social-impact-program-best-practices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the ACCP conference</a> in March to a group of corporate responsibility and corporate philanthropy professionals, but we were excited to share it with employees who experience their companies&#8217; positive impact programs and are passionate about developing mission-driven companies.<br />\nOur guests were eager to engage in thought-provoking conversations and asked great questions. Some of our guests commented that they saw a lot of grassroots organizing at their organizations, where employees are empowered to coordinate positive impact programs together &#8216; but there didn&#8217;t seem to be a larger corporate or executive sponsorship. Others commented that their executive teams were extremely passionate and supportive of positive impact programs at work &#8216; but it wasn&#8217;t being measured or fully incorporated into the business.<br />\nThese challenges &#8216; while frustrating &#8216; are not foreign to us. Using the Four C&#8217;s framework to reflect on your organization&#8217;s maturity when it comes to positive impact programs is the first step to improvement. From there you can begin to tackle each of the the Four C&#8217;s in the order that feels most natural based on your strengths and your company&#8217;s culture. If you don&#8217;t feel like any of the Four C&#8217;s are in place at your organization, we recommend starting with Commit. Identify what causes and initiatives are important to your business and gain the consensus and buy-in from the top of the organization.<br />\nWeSpire applies this methodology to help our customers identify where their strengths lie within the 4 C&#8217;s framework. From there we can help them create a tailored strategy, utilizing the WeSpire platform as well as other available resources, to build out the areas that they&#8217;re lacking in.<br />\nRead our latest <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/customer-spotlight-spier-wine-farm-sustainability-engagement-success-story/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">customer spotlight on Spier Wine Farm</a> to see how it used the WeSpire platform to successfully engage its employees in company-wide sustainability initiatives.
