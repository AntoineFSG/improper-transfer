My destination was a CEO-only summit for the top 100 fastest growing SaaS companies. For the first time, WeSpire made the list. </span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I arrived slightly late due to the weather, walked into the room of 40+ CEOs and was relieved as a friendly face, Matt Bellows, a fellow Boston Founder, waved me over to his table and pulled out a chair. Then I looked around the room and my suspicion from a cursory review of the attendee list was confirmed. Yep, I was the only female in the room.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m very used to being in the minority. It started in grade school before girls had their own soccer  teams. Continued into management consulting where most client teams only had one female on them. Then I went to a business school with a 75/25 ratio. Now I’m in tech, where only </span><a href=\"https://ratedly.com/women-in-tech-report/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10% of executives are women.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I find it easy to get along well with men and have had several outstanding male mentors. I’ve also experienced inequities and endured my fair share of ridiculous comments along the way.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the break, the organizer thanked me profusely for attending and I asked him if I was the only female CEO on the list. “No, there are 15 others, but they just didn’t show up,” he said in an exasperated tone. As he moved away, Matt asked me if I was speaking, which I wasn’t. “That’s ridiculous. Would you be open to it?” he asked. I thought for a moment and said, “of course”.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know exactly what Matt said to the organizer, but he likely pointed out that a) every speaker was a white guy b) I have a lot of great experience and c) one reason many of the male CEOs attended was because they’d been asked to speak. If he wanted to ensure better representation, he could have included some of the female CEOs on the agenda.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So at 11am that morning, I found myself on stage, sharing our experience with venture debt to a room full of peers only because a fellow Founder exhibited what it means to be an ally.  He noticed an imbalance and spoke up. The room shifted just a little that day as a result. </span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all face opportunities in life to be an ally, but it requires a mix of awareness, empathy, courage and persuasion. First, you have to recognize your own privilege. It’s not easy and might be uncomfortable, but everyone has some traits that give them an advantage. It’s not only gender, sexual orientation or racial differences. Are you able-bodied? Are you raising kids with a partner? Are you in the majority age group at work? Second, you have to use your own emotional intelligence and situational awareness to notice when someone is unique or different and may not feel included as a result. A friendly wave and a chair can be a lifeboat for anyone, but particularly someone who’s feeling different. Third, allies use their voice. A kind smile isn’t enough. Allies call out exclusionary behavior, repeat someone’s statement when they’ve been interrupted and give people credit when they are being overlooked. Finally, allies share their ideas and persuade others to improve a situation. I don’t think it took a ton of persuasion for the organizer of the conference to change course, he just needed Matt to push the idea. </span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Society needs allies. From CEOs and executive teams to middle-managers or factory line workers, data shows that being a minority at work, of any type, at any level, causes increased levels of stress and more negative health outcomes. So as you go about your week, can you look around and find a way to be an ally? Someone out there, maybe even your CEO, needs you.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Quote of the week</strong>:  “People never remember the crowd; they remember the one person that had the courage to say and do what no one would do.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">― Shannon L.

The result is that I read, think, and learn a lot about the intersection of purpose, impact and leadership and have a few successes and a lot more “lessons learned.” I realized that my own insights may be helpful to other purpose-driven professionals if I took the time to reflect each week. If you find this inspiring, practical or helpful, I’d be honored if you shared it with your colleagues, your families and your friends.</p>\n<p>Read Previous Week&#8217;s Saturday Spark: <a href=\"https://www.wespire.com/how-to-clean-your-closets-and-change-your-culture/\">How Cleaning Your Closets Can Change Your Culture</a><br />\nRead Following Week&#8217;s Saturday Spark: <a href=\"https://www.wespire.com/this-online-quiz-can-change-the-world/\">This Online Quiz Can Save the World</a><br />\n[DISPLAY_ULTIMATE_SOCIAL_ICONS]</p>\n","slug":"saturday-spark-why-even-ceos-need-allies","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"ccea18b4-50b7-52b0-9bbf-ec9665e75c55"}}}
