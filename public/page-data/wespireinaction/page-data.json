Below are the three principles that have helped shape our organization and made our users so successful.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\n<strong>1. We inspire people to build a better working world</strong><br />\nHere at WeSpire we are on a mission to build a better working world. Through the use of our platform we provide organizations and individuals the ability to connect, share, learn, and take action on the issues and causes they care most about. It&#8217;s amazing to see the commitment and impact of our users.<br />\n<strong>2. We believe business can be a force for good</strong><br />\nSeventy-eight percent of consumers want companies to address important social justice issues, and seventy-four percent of employees say their job is more fulfilling when they are provided opportunities to make a positive impact on social and environmental issues. Businesses have a huge opportunity to rise up to the challenge, helping to drive change locally and globally. We are proud to work with organizations who get it, and are helping to revolutionize the workplace.<br />\n<strong>3. We know that small actions add up</strong><br />\nDon&#8217;t underestimate the power of actions, no matter how small. Whether it&#8217;s taking public transportation instead of driving, saving leftovers, or turning the water off while brushing your teeth, the savings associated with these simple actions add up to create a lasting impact. We are proud to see the amazing progress the organizations and individuals we work with have already made and continue to make on our platform.<br />\nOur new Campaign celebrates these amazing individuals and all that they&#8217;ve been able to accomplish by utilizing the WeSpire platform.<br />\nHere&#8217;s a sneak preview, we hope you follow along on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn with the hashtag #WeSpireInAction!<br />\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2362 size-large\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/WeSpireInAction-Campaign-1024x512.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<em>Have your own WeSpire success story?
