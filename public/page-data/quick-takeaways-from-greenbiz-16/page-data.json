The setting, in the Arizona desert, is a perennial favorite among executives, especially for those of us who live in blustery weather zones.<br />\nA convening like Green Biz opens up like wine: new connections, recharged partnerships, pithy principles, and super-charged initiatives develop over the ensuing months. Check the GreenBiz site for ongoing conclusions and thought-leader news.<br />\nFor now, we have some quick fresh impressions from <strong><u><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/evolving-role-of-the-cso-greenbiz16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WeSpire&#8217;s delegation</a></u></strong> that we&#8217;d love to share ASAP, peppered with a few of the top tweets we noticed on the (super busy) #GrnBz stream.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sustainability means different things to different stakeholders.

We were all agreeing on the North Star goal, and we&#8217;re getting back together to reevaluate.

Join via <a href=\"pwc.to:redcarpet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Huffington Post</a>.<br />\nNish Murthy<em>, WeSpire&#8217;s head of Customer Success</em>, took notes on the spot:<br />\nMillennials are not the same. They come in three buckets. 1) Fresh out of college are just looking for a job&#8230;not purpose, not anything more&#8230;just a job. 2) When they are a couple of years in, then they start asking &#8220;is this it?&#8221;&#8230;is this all this job is? 3) People who have been there about 4 years start looking for deeper purpose/meaning.<br />\nAnother interesting point was that millennials aren&#8217;t trying to avoid face-to-face interactions. They use technology to facilitate these face-to-face conversations and because technology helps them communicate real time. (Thanks for the WeSpire shout-out on this point, Joel Makower!)<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pie-chart-CSO-from-SHS-GreenBiz-preso.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1474 alignright\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pie-chart-CSO-from-SHS-GreenBiz-preso-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Pie chart CSO from SHS GreenBiz preso\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Another Five sparkly stars for <em>WeSpire CEO</em> Susan Hunt Stevens, who led a popular session about <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/evolving-role-of-the-cso-greenbiz16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Evolving Role of the CSO</a>. In this high-energy chat,<br />\nparticipants attached colorful labels to indicate where the sustainability practice lives at their corporation, showing a positive trend in the combination of strategy, innovation and sustainability; and an increasing number of sustainability teams reporting into the C-Suite&#8217;CEO, President or COO.

Simply put, instead of focusing on how corporations can be less bad,&#8217; its how can they be a force for good and make the world better! For example, Rio Tinto has made a public commitment to have a net positive impact on biodiversity. For Dell, the good will be 10x the use. Unilever is committed to being &#8220;carbon positive.&#8221; It&#8217;s a fascinating approach that business as usual&#8217; cannot address&#8217;and it will require hugely innovative solutions and collaborations, new ways of thinking, and new ways of measuring outcomes. <a href=\"http://www.bsr.org/en/our-insights/blog-view/can-net-positive-help-inspire-a-race-to-the-top\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Check out</a> the new and collaborative Net Positive Project, launching summer 2016.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We&#8217;re sending our team home for a well-deserved weekend break.
