RECOGNITION, REWARDS, AND THE POWER OF AUTHENTICITY","content":"<p><em>New WeSpire Employee Engagement White Paper Deep-Dives into the Power of Honest Praise for a Job Well Done.</em><br />\n<!--more--><br />\nAccording to Gallup, recognition motivates 82% of employees to improve their job performance. They&#8217;ve also <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/services/182138/state-american-manager.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">discovered</a> that a top factor to raise overall employee engagement is regular praise and recognition from managers. This is <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/evolution-of-employee-engagement-research-2015/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">especially true</a> for Millennials.<br />\nManagers derive real value when they go through the steps to strip redundant or outdated layers from their Recognition &amp; Rewards programs. They&#8217;re inventing programs to delight and surprise employees and stay true to the brand, as Mary Kay&#8217;s pink Cadillacs did for decades&#8217;and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/07/29/427318543/pink-cadillacs-takeover-as-mary-kay-mania-hits-dallas\">still do</a>, for a certain slice of the working population.<br />\nJosh Bersin&#8217;s team at Deloitte <a href=\"https://www.bersin.com/News/Content.aspx?id=15543\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">finds</a> that global workplace Recognition programs are inefficient and ripe for disruption:<br />\nWe estimate that the recognition market is over $45 billion in size and is mostly focused on rewarding tenure, Bersin says&#8217;that is, $45 billion targeted at how long you&#8217;ve been working here, oddly; and not focused on your performance and accomplishments. Our research found that these programs drive very little value at all&#8217; only 58% of the employees we surveyed even know that their company has such a program.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Only 58% of the employees we surveyed even know that their company has such a program.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Talent coach Meghan Biro puts it <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/249460\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this way</a>: In many organizations, recognition and financial reward are joined at the hip. An employee does something above and beyond and receives a gift card or a lunch with the boss; a team achieves a goal and is rewarded with a party. These rewards, however, can backfire; they tell the employee that he or she is worth <em>n </em>dollars to the organization for some level of effort. We say, challenge yourselves to a more creative&#8217;and brand-appropriate&#8217;reward that&#8217;s tied into company goals.<br />\nWith four (and arguably, five) generations working full-time, and rich cultural diversities also in play, managers must be sensitive to various preferences. Including&#8217;and especially&#8217;timing.<br />\nTo get the full story and key takeaways on how you can create a rewards and recognition program that will resonate with your entire workforce, <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/whats-in-a-thank-youqs_detailwhite_paperqs_resource_namerewards_and_recognition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">download our Rewards and Recognition white paper today</a>.<br />\n<em>What are your favorite ways to be recognized or to recognize members of your team?
