But who&#8217;s really owning it in an enterprise organization?<!--more--><br />\nWe&#8217;ve talked to business leaders with titles like Chief People Officer, Head of Employee Engagement, and Director of Employee Engagement and Communication, all of whom are dedicated to keeping their employees engaged, productive, challenged and happy at work. Even if your organization doesn&#8217;t have a dedicated leader with Employee Engagement in their title, someone is most likely taking it on as part of their role.

This grassroots demand for a purpose filled, engaging workplace has quickly escalated to a business priority, and for good reason. Gallup reports that actively disengaged employees cost the U.S $450 billion to $550 billion in lost productivity every year.<br />\nBusinesses are fighting back against this number by providing a variety of employee engagement programs, from health and wellness, to sustainability to volunteering and more. And while different programs may have different owners, in order to be as successful as possible there needs to be a single entity that champions &#8216; and measures &#8216; employee engagement.<br />\n<strong>Sustainability&#8217;s Employee Engagement Champion</strong><br />\nAs more sustainability teams work to bring employee stakeholders into their programs, they can greatly benefit from working with their organization&#8217;s employee engagement champions.
