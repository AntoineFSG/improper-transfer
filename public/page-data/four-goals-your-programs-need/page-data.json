Let&#8217;s dive a little deeper into each of these concepts.<br />\n<strong>Create Economic Value</strong><br />\nThink about how your company is currently impacting society and the benefits that you provide to your consumers. Keep your goals focused on creating value for customers and potential customers. Setting both short-term and long-term goals for the business will increase your chance of continuing to offer product and services that make an impact on society.<br />\n<strong>Offer a Great Place to Work</strong><br />\nIf you don&#8217;t already have a system in place, set a goal to assess employee engagement and/or satisfaction levels. Systems such as Gallup&#8217;s Q12  and Net Promoter Score can help you gain these important benchmarks. If you already have a benchmark set a data-driven goal to improve the number and identify the programs that can help you achieve your goals.<br />\n<strong>Be a Good Neighbor</strong><br />\nIn addition to setting goals related to your product, services and workforce, a positive business also measures itself on its societal impact. Identify local non-profits or causes that you believe your business could positively impact. Create goals that outline how you want to support these causes and the impact that you hope to make.<br />\n<strong>Help to Solve Some of the World&#8217;s Biggest Challenges</strong><br />\nMany of the local non-profits and causes that you choose to support will be fighting to solve some of the world&#8217;s biggest challenges. Focus on the issues that matter most to your business and identify the different ways that you can help to solve them. Volunteering, philanthropy and spreading awareness of these challenges are all different ways to help you achieve your goal of playing a part in solving some of the world&#8217;s biggest challenges.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>What positive impact initiatives is your organization working towards in 2017?</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","slug":"four-goals-your-programs-need","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"dc9788a4-397c-5c9b-9819-5e3cb463c712"}}}
