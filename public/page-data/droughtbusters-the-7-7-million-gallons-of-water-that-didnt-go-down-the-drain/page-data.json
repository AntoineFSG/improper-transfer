This is evidenced in many parts of the U.S. and the world, which are in the midst of a severe drought. On the west coast, <strong>California is in its third consecutive year of drought, having only received 20% of its average rainfall</strong>. This is <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/watch/658384\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">affecting</a> households, corporations, and entire industries.<!--more--></p>\n<h4>Mitigating the problem through simple actions</h4>\n<p>This past February, one of our customers asked WeSpire to help them and their employees reduce their water use. We responded by creating the Droughtbusters corporate water stewardship project. Like all our projects, Droughtbusters contains a list of simple actions coupled with information that both raises awareness and provides actionable steps for employees to take. By breaking each project down into specific actions, what may seem like an abstract goal &#8216; in this case, conserve water &#8216; turns into a relatively easy, and fun, roadmap for long-term impactful behavior change.</p>\n<h4>Simple actions add up quickly</h4>\n<p>What started out as a customized project for one company, turned into a <strong>successful corporate water stewardship campaign in over ten organizations</strong>. Since Droughtbusters launched this past March, over 83,000 water-saving actions were recorded via the project. All of those actions add up to a savings of 7.7 million gallons of water. For context, that is equal to filling 220,000 bathtubs. Financially, all of the recorded Droughtbuster actions are equal to over $91,000 in savings (including emissions and energy impacts in addition to water). That&#8217;s a serious chunk of change alongside a big pool of water (the reservoir).<br />\nSo of the 30 Droughtbuster actions, which ones are the most popular? Here&#8217;s a list of the 10 most frequently completed, along with the number of times it has been completed:</p>\n<table style=\"height: 452px; border-spacing: 2px; border-color: grey;\" width=\"496\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Action</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Times Completed</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth</td>\n<td>  9,741</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wash a full load of laundry</td>\n<td>  8,659</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wait to run the dishwasher until it&#8217;s full</td>\n<td>  7,623</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Take a shower that is 5 minutes or less</td>\n<td>  7,142</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wear clothes and use towels more than once before washing</td>\n<td>  6,058</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Load the dishwasher without rinsing dishes thoroughly</td>\n<td>  5,789</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Turn off the water while washing hands</td>\n<td>  5,445</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Turn off the faucet while shaving</td>\n<td>  5,124</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Use a broom instead of a hose to clean your driveway</td>\n<td>  3,737</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Water plants in the morning (or coolest part of the day)</td>\n<td>  3,533</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nEach of these actions is a relatively minor shift in behavior. What&#8217;s interesting, though, is that each of the top 10 actions can be completed regularly, some, even a few times a day.<br />\nThe drought is not something we can easily remedy, however as the Droughtbusters corporate water stewardship project proves, minor <a href=\"/robin-krieglstein-behavior-change-designer-extraordinaire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">changes in behavior</a> add up to big&#8217;positive&#8217;outcomes.<br />\nTo learn more about how we calculate our water, waste, energy, fuel and emissions impacts, read up on our <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/faqs/\">methodology</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"/platform\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-283\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/trash2-300x282.png\" alt=\"sustainability and corporate water stewardship\" width=\"104\" height=\"98\" /></a><em><a title=\"Platform\" href=\"/platform\">Read more about WeSpire&#8217;s Sustainability engagement library</a> that inspires employees to take action and impact social and environmental outcomes.</em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"droughtbusters-the-7-7-million-gallons-of-water-that-didnt-go-down-the-drain","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"3b43973f-5c6d-5d4c-8dde-8b712e6459e5"}}}
