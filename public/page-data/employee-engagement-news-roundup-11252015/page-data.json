The survey results show the majority of Millennials care most about improving society, instilling purpose in their work and are far more concerned with how employees are treated at a company than their personal income. Deloitte says <strong>businesses need to revisit their core, and understand their true purpose</strong> if they hope to attract and retain young employees.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.inc.com/alison-davis/5-surprising-things-to-be-thankful-for-at-work.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 Surprising Things To Be Thankful For (At Work)</a></h3>\n<p>During the holidays we are given the opportunity to take time off of work, spend time with family and friends and give thanks for everything important in our lives. But when giving thanks we often overlook our jobs and the opportunities given to us in the workplace. So in the spirit of Thanksgiving tomorrow, this article shares the importance of being thankful for our work: for our small wins, the constant competition that makes us better, the opportunities to continue learning, and our co-workers who support us, help us innovate, and keep us engaged at work. <strong>We hope you all take time this holiday season to </strong>self reflect<strong> and spend time with loved ones</strong>&#8216;and we&#8217;re thankful to be part of your weekly routine!
