Other governments are following suit. According to the New York Times, civil servants in Britain are being trained in behavioral science. And governments in Australia, Denmark and South Africa are also working to change how people behave in predictable ways through applied behavioral science.<br />\nWhile behavioral science can offer policymakers useful insights to improve public programs, these studies can also be applied to broader audiences. In theory, behavioral science can be applied wherever human behavior plays a role&#8217;including within the corporate arena.<br />\nImagine a company that wants to persuade tens of thousands of employees to engage around a corporate initiative to help them save for retirement, or to protect their organization from cyber criminals by taking necessary actions to keep their information safe.<br />\nCapturing the attention and passion of employees is incredibly challenging, and it&#8217;s almost impossible when the organization&#8217;s workforce in unengaged. Solving for this issue, organizations adopt cutting-edge behavior-design technologies to provide comprehensive and accessible systems.<br />\n<strong>The result: employees are engaged in positive-impact initiatives such as sustainability, volunteering, health and well-being, and more.</strong><br />\nOur latest whitepaper, <em>Embracing Behavioral Science to Better Serve Your Workforce</em>, offers actionable advice for organizations to implement employee <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/employee-engagement-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">engagement programs</a> that deeply integrate behavioral science.<br />\nBehavioral science is a growing field with extensive experimentation and impact, and it is really starting to scale. Understanding its power will help organizations better implement programs to help employees consume energy more thoughtfully, waste less, and drive positive impact, thus <strong>improving the bottom line for people, the organizations they work for, and the planet</strong>.</p>\n","slug":"leverage-a-global-mandate-to-execute-your-corporate-initiatives-2","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"59a9731b-962c-54a4-b44a-0e324aa06991"}}}
