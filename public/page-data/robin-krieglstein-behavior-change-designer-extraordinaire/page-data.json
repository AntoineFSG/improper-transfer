We felt that new technologies like social networks and mobile, game mechanics and great content could be melded together to make it easier for people to take new actions. Organizations across the world are starting to realize this as well, and  it is expected that by 2015 <strong>40% of all Fortune 1000 companies will use gamification  to transform business operations </strong>(Source: <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gartnergroup/2013/01/21/the-gamification-of-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forbes</a>).<!--more--><br />\nWhat we didn&#8217;t know at the time is that there is an amazing tribe of people out there pioneering in this field as well&#8217;and some had been at it for decades.  The field is referred to as persuasive technology and designing for behavior change. One of our favorite people in this space is Robin Krieglstein, who we met on a panel at <a href=\"http://sxsweco.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SXSW Eco</a> while he was a senior producer for <a href=\"http://badgeville.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Badgeville</a>. He&#8217;s been a member of BJ Fogg&#8217;s team at <a href=\"http://captology.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stanford</a> and helped build <a href=\"http://www.behaviorwizard.org/wp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BehaviorWizard.org</a>. He&#8217;s also been helpful to the team at WeSpire.  We thought who better than Robin to share more with our blog readers about this exciting work.</p>\n<h4><strong>How did the field of persuasive technology come to be? What&#8217;s the background and history behind it?</strong></h4>\n<p>There are many intertwining threads of history to the field. I began exploring how to improve the behavior of large numbers of people through technology more than 20 years ago. More broadly, I think the stage was set when <a href=\"http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/seligman.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Martin Seligman</a>, as president of the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Psychological Association</a>, called for psychology to expand beyond just what can go wrong, but also what can go right in the workings of the human mind.<br />\nOf course the real beginning was when <a href=\"http://www.bjfogg.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. BJ Fogg</a> began exploring how to design behavior solutions that work. He found that traditional approaches led to failure so he decided to ignore what he&#8217;d learned and start fresh. The resulting <a href=\"http://www.behaviormodel.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fogg Behavior Model</a>, <a href=\"http://www.foggmethod.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fogg Method</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.behaviorgrid.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fogg Behavior Grid</a> took the world by storm just as lots of people started realizing that the limiting factor in so many areas of society is human behavior.</p>\n<h4><strong>How would you explain persuasive technology to your grandmother?</strong></h4>\n<p>I prefer to refer to Designing for Behavior Change or Behavior Design. Most of the practitioners I know, and Dr. Fogg himself, are really focused on helping people achieve behavior changes <em>they themselves already want to make</em>. Rather than persuading people to do something they don&#8217;t want to.<br />\nSimply put, Behavior Design is about helping people improve their behavior.<br />\nLet&#8217;s take exercise. Most people wish they would exercise more but seem to have a lot of trouble doing it. <a href=\"https://captology.stanford.edu/projects/behaviordesign.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Behavior Design</a> is about setting things up to help people move from wanting&#8217; to doing&#8217;.  To do this we might design software, video, text, events, systems or pretty much any other experience that you can design for.</p>\n<h4><strong>What trends are propelling growth in this field?</strong></h4>\n<p>I think there is a dawning realization in all areas of society, that increasing technology and abundance alone cannot solve all our problems. Increasingly, people realize that the key to solving so many seemingly intractable problems is in figuring out how to reliably change human behavior at scale.<br />\nAdditionally, the ever increasing melding of technology &amp; media into all areas of our life opens the possibility that we could design behavioral interventions that impact all areas of life. If you are trying to address a human problem, you can likely find a media source nearby that could be used to inject an intervention.<br />\nAnd finally, people are beginning to feel really confident that behavioral interventions are possible. Psychology has really matured as a field, and there is a lot of fantastic new research outlining the strange workings of the human mind, and how to bend behavior toward positive action.</p>\n<h4><strong>Can you give some examples that people might be familiar with of a program or app that uses some of the thinking behind designing for behavior change?</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.weightwatchers.com/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Weight Watchers</a> has worked with Dr. Fogg to tackle the very challenging behavior change involved in weight loss. And <a href=\"http://instagram.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram</a> co-founder Mike Krieger famously applied concepts from his classes with Dr. Fogg to make Instagram a habit for millions of users.</p>\n<h4><strong>Tell me about a few &#8220;lessons learned&#8221; in your career of designing for behavior change.  What&#8217;s worked that surprised you and what hasn&#8217;t that you thought would?</strong></h4>\n<p>I think the number one thing is humility. I constantly see new behavior design efforts fall prey to the great man fallacy. They waste all their initial energy building the vision that they are so confident will work. Behavior change is hard. You need to come in knowing that you don&#8217;t know all the answers and will spend most of your time discovering the right answers. You need to build a machine to hypothesize, test, learn and iterate; and then get the velocity on that loop as fast as you can to increase your odds of success.<br />\nAlso, design meticulously for relapses. They&#8217;re inevitable. If you allow relapses to cause shame, guilt or embarrassment, your product is dead in the water. Giving more negative feedback just decreases a user&#8217;s ability to follow through. Craft a hero&#8217;s story where the user faces significant setbacks, but also inevitably rises to the occasion and triumphs.<br />\nHumans are social to the core. Social, social, social. Place your users in an environment where people are succeeding all around them, and are helping each other succeed, and then you&#8217;ll succeed with your intervention.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\"  alignleft wp-image-335\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire behavior change blog\" width=\"150\" height=\"53\" /></a>Like what you read? <a href=\"/blog\">Visit the WeSpire blog and subscribe</a> to keep up to date with employee engagement programs backed by behavioral science.</em></p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Robin_Headshot_2014.jpg\"><img class=\"  alignleft wp-image-577\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Robin_Headshot_2014-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Robin Krieglstein behavior change designer extraordinnaire\" width=\"179\" height=\"179\" /></a>Robin</span> has a 20+ year passion for applying behavioral psychology through technology to improve human behavior.
