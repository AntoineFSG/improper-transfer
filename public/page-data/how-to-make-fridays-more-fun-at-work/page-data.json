Things can get hectic and stressful during the week and Friday is a great time to stop for a second and share a good laugh with the people that worked through it all with you.<br />\nHere are a few ideas on how you could break up some of the monotony of the week on a Friday and get everyone to smile a little.<br />\n1. <strong>Office pranks:</strong> Pranks and jokes are a simple way to lighten the mood.
