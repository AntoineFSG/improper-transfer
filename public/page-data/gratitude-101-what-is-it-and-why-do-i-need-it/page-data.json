Robert Emmons, a professor at UC Davis and leading expert in gratitude has a comprehensive, two-part definition:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Gratitude is an affirmation of goodness.</strong> By expressing gratitude, we acknowledge that there are good things in the world and that we&#8217;ve received its gifts and benefits. It&#8217;s important to note that gratitude doesn&#8217;t ignore the bad things and hassles of life, but rather encourages us to identify some amount of goodness in our life. <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">(</span><a href=\"http://ctt.ec/edRKz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tweet this</a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">)</span></span></li>\n<li><strong> Gratitude involves figuring out where that goodness comes from.</strong> Expressing gratitude often reveals that many sources of goodness are outside of ourselves.<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> (</span><a href=\"http://ctt.ec/jo036\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tweet this</a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">)</span></span> We can still be proud of our traits and what we accomplish, but Dr. Emmons believes that true gratitude involves a humble dependence on others. By this he means that we acknowledge that other people&#8217;or even higher powers, if you&#8217;re of a spiritual mindset&#8217;help us achieve the goodness in our lives.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote><p>None is more impoverished than the one who has no gratitude. Gratitude is a currency that we can mint for ourselves, and spend without fear of bankruptcy. &#8212; Fred De Witt Van Amburgh</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Benefits of Gratitude</h3>\n<p>The concept of expressing gratitude may seem like a light and fluffy practice, but it has been found to have significant and measurable benefits. In one study executed by Dr. Emmons, two groups of people were asked to keep a weekly journal. One group was asked to fill it with expressions of gratitude and the other was asked to write about the stressors or neutral events of their lives. The results: those who kept a gratitude journal were found to exercise more regularly, have fewer physical ailments, and feel better and more optimistic about their lives.<br />\nAdditional research done on gratitude has found:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily discussions of gratitude results in higher reported levels of alertness, enthusiasm, determination, attentiveness, energy and sleep duration and quality.</li>\n<li>Gratitude is a relationship-strengthening emotion because it requires us to see how we&#8217;ve been supported and affirmed by other people.</li>\n<li>People who rank higher on gratitude scales are less likely to retaliate against others and experience more sensitivity and empathy towards other people.</li>\n<li>Writing in a gratitude journal improves sleep.</li>\n<li>Gratitude reduces social comparisons and increases self-esteem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1983\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GratitudeChallenge.png\" alt=\"gratitude challenge\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><br />\nAre you interested in getting started in kicking-off your gratitude journey?
