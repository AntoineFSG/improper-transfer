Today, more and more leading organizations are taking this tried and true method, and applying it to the workplace to understand their employer brand.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h3><strong>What is eNPS and How is it Calculated?</strong></h3>\n<p>eNPS, is a simple, one question survey established by <a href=\"http://www.netpromotersystem.com/about/employee-engagement.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bain &amp; Company</a> to determine how likely an employee is to recommend their company as a place to work. This type of survey is usually accompanied by a follow-up question or area to submit comments, so the employer has a better understanding as to why that score was given and can identify areas for improvement.<br />\nEmployees are asked to say how likely they are, on a 0-10 scale, to recommend their company as a place to work. A rating of 0-6 puts an employee in the detractor category, 7-8 in the passive bucket, and 9-10s are company promoters. To determine a business&#8217; eNPS, subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. Round up or down, using standard decimal rules, and there&#8217;s your eNPS. Your organizations eNPS is not meant to be a fixed score because the survey is administered on a semi-regular basis, it&#8217;s meant to be a flexible tool to help organizations keep a pulse on their workforce.</p>\n<h3><strong>Three Benefits of Using eNPS</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Identifies Areas for Improvement</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Utilizing the eNPS allows your organization to identify areas for improvement. If a large number of employees on a certain team are detractors, you may want to examine the stressors their department is under, processes in place, or the middle managers. Conversely, if a specific group or team scored the company fairly high, understanding their reasoning or what differentiates their team is a good place to start when trying to make organization-wide improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Gives Your Employees a Voice</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The eNPS provides an outlet for your employees to be heard and to share their feedback or ideas. Be sure to communicate the overall findings and what you plan to do with their feedback and ideas back to your employees. Doing the research but not showing employees how you plan to make changes risks leaving your employees feeling even more frustrated and disengaged at work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Creates a Transparent Culture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When implementing an eNPS you have the opportunity to bring more transparency to your organization. By being open and honest with your employees about the survey process, their feedback, and communicating any changes and improvements that come from it, you&#8217;ll instill a larger sense of trust amongst your employee base. This is very important, as a recent study by <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/popular-topics/hr-stats.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glassdoor</a> found that 90 percent of job seekers say it&#8217;s important to work for a company that embraces transparency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Has implementing eNPS at your organization made you or your employees more engaged or productive at work?</em></p>\n","slug":"businesses-use-employee-net-promoter-system","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"6a29dca5-d56e-564d-8988-7d37061ba111"}}}
