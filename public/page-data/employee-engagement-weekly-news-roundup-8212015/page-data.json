The most innovative and impactful challenge is using sustainability as a way to add purpose and value to your organization&#8217;s work experience. For this to happen, the author stresses that the notion of purpose must be embedded within (an organization&#8217;s) culture. For most companies the promise of purpose can&#8217;t only focus on what they do; every organization should focus on the way they do things such as product innovation, community outreach programs, and employee development programs.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.hrotoday.com/news/engaged-workforce/getting-on-track/\">Getting on Track</a></h3>\n<p>WeSpire&#8217;s own Susan Hunt Stevens (CEO &amp; Founder of WeSpire) recaps and discusses the latest research on employee engagement, including best practices for manager-employee relationships, transparency in the workplace, and choice and collaboration for corporate programs. Susan makes the case for investing time and money in engagement programs, research, and collaboration as WeSpire&#8217;s data shows that not only do employees want more options to get involved in the workplace, they expect it from their employers.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/aug/15/google-cars-pollution-environment-silicon-valley-alphabet\">Businesses delivering the most coveted perk: a better commute</a></h3>\n<p>For companies like Google that offer alternatives for commuting to work (shuttles, buses, carpool programs, work from home flexibility, etc) these services can often look and feel like perks for the job. However, the benefits of driving less begin adding up immediately when you factor in the reduced pollution, parking space needed, and improved quality of life for employees. Employees feel that their organization cares and is invested in making their life easier/efficient/less stressful. The trick to getting employees to drive less is to improve their ability to find options and try something just once and that&#8217;s where behavior change and inspiration for action become so important.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.afr.com/leadership/company-culture/is-it-time-to-sack-the-annual-employee-engagement-survey-20150810-givd0r\">Is it time to sack the annual employee engagement survey?</a></h3>\n<p>There has been quite a bit of talk about the dangers of performance reviews and the annual employee satisfaction surveys. The author argues that the surveys are often out of date by the time the results are finalized and published and were really designed with the HR department processes in mind, not employees. To transition from being administration-centered to employee-centered, companies should conduct temperature gauges through frequent pulse surveys (once a month or once a week), delivered digitally and available on phones, tablets and computers.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.fastcoexist.com/3049540/5-ways-to-convince-people-to-actually-do-something-about-climate-change\">5 Ways To Convince People To Actually Do Something About Climate Change</a></h3>\n<p>Whether you believe in climate change or not, it&#8217;s hard to deny that there has been a lot of research coming out to either support or refute the argument. Regardless of how your organization stands, more and more companies are at least acknowledging their responsibility to reduce their effect on the earth. The author reflects on some recent research that shares 5 best practices for how to communicate about the topic. Our favorites are numbers 2, 3, and 5. Instead of focusing on the negative, be public and share the positive via social networks and internal communication systems, and find ways to enable employees to take positive action at the workplace.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\"  wp-image-335 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire blog image\" width=\"175\" height=\"62\" /></a>Visit the <a href=\"/blog\">WeSpire blog</a> and subscribe to get the latest employee engagement articles delivered straight into your inbox.</p></blockquote>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-weekly-news-roundup-8212015","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"397cb0c8-6655-52d9-b408-7d360d83c538"}}}
