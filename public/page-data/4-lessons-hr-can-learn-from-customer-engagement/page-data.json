While most of our customers cater to their employees, NBCU&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.greenisuniversal.com/\">Green is Universal</a> uniquely supports consumers through its WeSpire platform, <a href=\"https://onesmallact.practicallygreen.com/?__hstc=220571463.58846e20568ca532e2c4c8de13efe29a.1415134805448.1421939407468.1421946751155.26&amp;__hssc=220571463.2.1421946751155&amp;__hsfp=3387357496\">One Small Act</a>. One Small Act is another voice for <a href=\"http://www.nbcuni.com/\">NBCU</a>&#8216;s sustainability efforts, open to the public. For a company like NBCU, initiatives such as these help spur growth since <strong>50% of global consumers are willing to spend more for goods and services from socially responsible companies </strong>(Source: <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2013/nielsen-50-percent-of-global-consumers-surveyed-willing-to-pay-more-fo.html\">Nielsen</a>).<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nRecently, the WeSpire team joined forces with Green is Universal to promote healthy and sustainable eating on One Small Act. Through the <a href=\"http://www.greenisuniversal.com/blog/one-small-act/enter-the-eco-eats-sweepstakes-win-a-naturebox-subscription/\">Eco Eats Challenge</a>, participants have access to 20 actions motivating them to cut down their meat consumption and increase their consumption of locally grown, organic produce.<br />\nThe beauty of the project is that anyone can participate in the Eco Eats Challenge! With such compelling actions around healthy eating, NBCU&#8217;s Eco Eats project exemplified the power of the collective. And as somebody who works with customers daily, I just love how NBCU has created a program that allows its customers to engage with it through the company&#8217;s core values.</p>\n<h4>Extending engagement from customers to employees</h4>\n<p>Engagement of this sort should not be limited to consumers and today, many HR departments are working to engage their own employees and align them around collaborative action and company values. Here are a few lessons that I have learned from customer engagement that can be equally applicable to employee engagement strategy:</p>\n<h4>Engagement is about behavior, not emotion</h4>\n<p>Many companies are focused on customer loyalty. They use a variety of proxies to try to measure what is ultimately an emotion. Instead of focusing on the emotion of loyalty, Curtis Bingham <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/2014/03/28/customer-loyalty-is-dead-long-live-engagement/\">argues</a>, companies should be focusing on their customers&#8217; behavior. How much time are their customers spending interacting with the company, or advocating for the company? Customer engagement may be the best indicator of loyalty and willingness to pay for the company&#8217;s products. HR departments should focus on getting their employees engaged and interacting with the company community and management to build that sense of loyalty that is often lacking.</p>\n<h4>Keeping customers is easier than finding new ones</h4>\n<p>So often, companies focus on going out and acquiring new customers, all while forgetting the value that their current customers bring. A good customer success department understands the <a href=\"http://blog.marketo.com/2014/10/looking-for-higher-marketing-roi-engage-your-customers.html\">high ROI of engaging customers</a>. The same holds true with employees. HR departments understand the high costs associated with finding and bringing on qualified talent, but often forget to continue engaging that talent until it is too late. A good employee engagement strategy will invest in current employees and improve employee retention, so that less time, and money, needs to be spent acquiring new ones.</p>\n<h4>You get more from your engaged customers</h4>\n<p>Highly-engaged customers spend more on average &#8216; <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/172637/why-customer-engagement-matters.aspx\">23% more</a> &#8216; than those who are unengaged. It is worth the time and the money to put effective engagement programs in place to keep customers connected with the brand. Likewise, highly engaged employees have been shown to be more productive than unengaged employees. A strategic investment in employee engagement programs that increase employee motivation, collaboration and communication can go a long way to optimizing the value of your workforce.</p>\n<h4>Metrics are vital</h4>\n<p>There are a <a href=\"http://blog.totango.com/2011/09/top-3-metrics-to-measure-customer-engagement/\">variety of ways</a> to measure customer engagement and the correct metric will differ based on the product or service in question. However, there is no doubt that metrics are necessary in order to run an effective engagement campaign. Measurement allows companies to understand the success of their campaign so that they can improve on it in the future. So too with employee engagement strategy should measurement be a vital part of HR&#8217;s plan. New technologies now allow managers to keep track of employee engagement levels and calculate ROI so that they can figure out what is working, what is not, and how to constantly improve.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><a href=\"/resource/hrs-role-in-an-engaged-sustainable-organization-the-business-case-impacting-the-bottom-line\"><img class=\"  alignleft wp-image-278\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HR-White-Paper-LP-Image-for-website-225x300.png\" alt=\"HR's role in employee engagement strategy\" width=\"100\" height=\"133\" /></a>Download our whitepaper <a href=\"/resource/hrs-role-in-an-engaged-sustainable-organization-the-business-case-impacting-the-bottom-line\">&#8220;HR&#8217;s Role in an Engaged and Sustainable Organization&#8221;</a> to learn more about how HR can lead the way in employee engagement programs for sustainability.</em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"4-lessons-hr-can-learn-from-customer-engagement","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"d8ce229a-e9e9-5f8d-9f8d-4b1ded0842e0"}}}
