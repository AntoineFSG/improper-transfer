We&#8217;ve put together a short survey with the goal of understanding what purpose means to you &#8216; and how you&#8217;re currently experiencing it in the workplace.<br />\nThe ever-more-frequent discussions of purpose at work are just a symptom of the rapidly changing world of work. The ability to work remotely, the rise of freelancers and contract jobs, the startup economy, crowdfunding, the gig economy, automation and many other factors have completely changed how we view work and the role it plays in our lives.<br />\nNo one will deny that we work to earn an income, but is that all we should expect from work? Can work energize, inspire and excite us? Can it give us a purpose? Here at WeSpire, we hope so.<br />\nI&#8217;m excited to learn more about how you all feel about purpose at work and identify what we can do to create a better working world.<br />\nYou can <a href=\"http://go.wespire.com/WeSpire-Purpose-Survey.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sign-up to receive the results</a> of our Purpose at Work research as soon as it&#8217;s available.</p>\n<h2>Take the Purpose at Work Survey!</h2>\n<p><script>(function(e,t,o,n){var s,c,i;e.SMCX=e.SMCX||[],t.getElementById(n)||(s=t.getElementsByTagName(o),c=s[s.length-1],i=t.createElement(o),i.type=\"text/javascript\",i.async=!0,i.id=n,i.src=[\"https:\"===location.protocol?\"https://\":\"http://\",\"widget.surveymonkey.com/collect/website/js/vu_2Fahn2P4EtI93KGbZ9b4bdBemW0Srq_2FDOFQ6z0oMFeiPJ_2BXDOP6Qufoi3QsY1Fv.js\"].join(\"\"),c.parentNode.insertBefore(i,c))})(window,document,\"script\",\"smcx-sdk\");</script><a style=\"font: 12px Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #999; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/customer-satisfaction-surveys/\"> Create your own user feedback survey </a></p>\n","slug":"purpose-at-work","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"9069bbf7-059c-521b-a2df-f218eadb60fd"}}}
