I&#8217;m sorry, but can I disrupt the buzzword industry for a moment? This word suggests that, in the increasingly frantic daily routine of the modern consumer, what he really yearns for is a new product that will explode in his life like a small hand grenade. </strong><br />\nCall us obsessed with efficient product design, but as we read through Daniel Gelernter&#8217;s attributes for a perfect product to improve life, we also think many of these points also apply to running a successful employee engagement strategy.<br />\n<strong>What I really want is something that unifies and simplifies the many threads of my life.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Think about all of the tactics you&#8217;re currently using to &#8220;engage&#8221; employees today. We meet organizations that rely on employee-engagement audits, but it&#8217;s not working for them. They might have 75-100 different programs focused on engaging employees, from softball leagues to global philanthropy. It&#8217;s confusing. At the same time, less than 1% of companies use technology to engage employees, recognize, and motivate them. Think about what you can do to bring these programs together. Benefits to one central employee-engagement platform:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8212; Your team is more likely to find out about and participate in programs they may have otherwise never heard of as a result of being exposed to all of the opportunities in one central location.<br />\n&#8212; Social mechanics allow people to get enthusiastic! Now the understand which of their colleagues are participating, and can quantify the impact they&#8217;re creating together.<br />\n&#8212; Inspire your employees to TAKE ACTION. Right now, the fractured nature of employee-engagement programs is forcing employees to choose which programs they&#8217;ll remember, care about, or use; and this reduces participation rates across all programs. Unfortunate, and fixable.<br />\n<strong>As the number of data sources and services increases, and volume rises from each, my life is transitioning from heavily overloaded to catastrophically overloaded.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/behavior-change-positive-impact-and-purposeful-work-there-is-no-right-way-to-do-it/\">Behavior change</a> is core to an employee engagement strategy. Consider this: you are asking people to do things they likely would not otherwise do. If <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/5-ways-to-plan-a-successful-earth-day-2016/\">sustainability</a> is the goal, you&#8217;re asking your employees to make small changes whose immediate effect is often hard to discern. If volunteering is a central component of your engagement strategy, you&#8217;re asking your team to dedicate one of their most precious commodities: Time.</li>\n<li>Get organized! When you have goals around things like increasing engagement, enhancing knowledge, reducing pollution, eliminating waste, losing weight, or lowering stress, it&#8217;s a challenge to keep everything coordinated. Be cognizant of all of the requests you&#8217;re making of your employees. You want to entice them, not overwhelm. Schedule your initiatives in one master location to see whether programs enhance one another, or conflict.</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t underestimate how all of these small asks can add up quickly on an already busy calendar. People won&#8217;t stay involved if they don&#8217;t grasp the impact they&#8217;re making. Be sure to communicate fresh results and updates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>I need something that will cost me fewer button clicks, fewer wasted thought cycles, fewer trips to different digital services before I&#8217;m able to see the entire picture.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simplicity is key. Early and often, ask yourself how this program could be even easier for people to participate in. Can you add single sign-on to the platform you&#8217;re using? Can you remove even a single click from any of the required steps? Make those improvements. And make them again! The result? A great experience for your users, who will recommend it to others. You&#8217;ll have a hit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanGelernter?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dan Gelernter</a> pleads,<strong>A Little Less Disruption, Please.
