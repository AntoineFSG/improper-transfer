The role of the Chief Sustainability Officer has arguably never been more important, or less precise!<br />\nHow is the role of the CSO changing? We see a convergence between sustainability and other areas of business,&#8221; Hunt Stevens says, &#8220;often driven by a materiality assessment of where the biggest opportunity for sustainability is in the organization.<br />\nFor example, leading food and beverage corporations may now develop long-term goals within a capacious framework that includes not only the end product, but its supply chain, sourcing considerations, ingredients, customers, and distribution channels. Consumer-facing brands are infusing their communications with content about sustainability and purpose. HR is transforming talent development and cultivation, harnessing the potential of the workforce and other influential stakeholders to drive positive impact.<br />\nHow does the CSO&#8217;s role and responsibility differ by industry, by company size, by region? &#8220;The largest organizations tend to have a sustainability team reporting into a CSO or a CSO/SVP or corporate responsibility. The team usually owns the standard aspects of sustainable operations, and reporting; and often includes supply chanin, procurement, or packaging, stakeholder engagement, and sustainable innovation. As companies are smaller, or at a regional division level, sustainability tends to be embedded into other roles or teams. Of course, there are always exceptions! I know one leader who reports to the General Counsel, which I think is fascinating.&#8221;<br />\nHunt Stevens continues, &#8220;My personal favorite has been watching the convergence of Sustainability/Corporate Social Responsibility and HR. I&#8217;ve now seen three or four companies where talent is a key differentiator, and it makes perfect sense, because sustainability is such a strong factor for recruiting, retaining, and engaging key personnel, especially among millennial groups.&#8221;<br />\nWeSpire <a href=\"mailto:http://www.wespire.com/resource/the-state-of-employee-engagement-in-sustainability-csr-survey-results/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research</a> supports the need to integrate sustainability throughout the business. Over 50% of employees would like to see their employer&#8217;s stance change on employee sustainability efforts, with Millennials leading all age groups.<br />\n<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"></a>For transformative change to succeed, people need to be aligned via inspiring leadership and clear strategy. This way, everyone understands the goal&#8217;and sees how to get there.<br />\nWe dug a little deeper and asked Susan the most common convergence of roles she&#8217;s seen lately. Her response: Sustainability and corporate social responsibility are a key pairing in the corporate world today. In part this is driven by the increasing emphasis from <a href=\"mailto:http://www.wespire.com/corporate-responsibility-and-the-long-view/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wall Street</a> to view companies through an Environmental, Social, &amp; Governance (ESG) framework.<br />\nTo hear more, please join Susan&#8217;s Green Biz session on Wednesday, February 24<sup>th</sup> from 4:30-5:30pm MST.
