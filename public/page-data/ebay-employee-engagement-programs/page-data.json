On average, only 31.5% of your employees are engaged, 51% of them are not engaged, and 17.5% are undermining your success by being actively disengaged. Fortunately, employee engagement programs are proven to drive significant impact on your business internally, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase employee productivity and profitability</li>\n<li>Improve morale and retention</li>\n<li>Reduce absenteeism and turnover</li>\n<li>Drive innovation, brand value and customer success</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>The How &amp; Why to Communicate Employee Engagement to External Stakeholders</h3>\n<p>However often less talked about is the external support employee engagement programs can have for business. In addition to these internal results, employee engagement programs can also support your business objectives externally. Specifically, <strong>employee engagement programs can</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve brand reputation</li>\n<li>Increase customer loyalty</li>\n<li>Act as a competitive differentiator</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But in order to drive these external benefits, all stakeholders have to know about your company&#8217;s success. How can you communicate the achievements of your employees&#8217; positive impacts at work, home and in the community with your stakeholders and the public?<br />\nA natural external avenue to showcase and communicate the success of employee engagement programs is in annual Corporate Social Responsibility or environmental sustainability reports. <a title=\"The State of Employee Engagement\" href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/the-state-of-employee-engagement-in-sustainability-csr-survey-results/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">65%</a> of employees want to learn about the sustainability efforts of their employer and coworkers, and 66% of people prefer to work for a company known for its CSR. As a result, companies are increasingly folding in sustainability, corporate citizenship and well-being into their employee engagement programs.</p>\n<h3>Social Innovation at eBay</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Full_Infographic_eBayInc._Little_Bits_of_Good-2.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-646\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Full_Infographic_eBayInc._Little_Bits_of_Good-2-1024x642.png\" alt=\"Full_Infographic_eBayInc._Little_Bits_of_Good-2\" width=\"900\" height=\"565\" /></a><br />\nOne company serving as a model for including employee engagement in their annual reporting is eBay Inc.

Supporting the data, eBay includes pictures and stories highlighting their employee engagement programs&#8217; success.</p>\n<h3>Four Ways to Communicate Success</h3>\n<p>Although many of the benefits of employee engagement are difficult to measure, as eBay exemplifies, there are a few ways to show off your program&#8217;s success to all of your stakeholders; here are a few steps to take:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Aggregate your data</strong>: Employees may not think that it is important to record an hour volunteering, a T-shirt given or a bottle recycled, but all these little actions do add up! Track you employees&#8217; impact. Not only will it act as an internal motivator and inspire others to pitch-in, together these actions are impressive to your external stakeholders and create good will and brand value.</li>\n<li><strong>Once you have your data, include it in annual your annual reporting</strong>: Public reports are a great time to take the time to step back and reflect on all the impact your employees have made. These public reports are a great resource for both your employees to learn about what their coworkers and employer are doing, but also a place for customers and prospective employees to learn about your success.</li>\n<li><strong>Capture photos of your employees in action</strong>: A picture is worth a thousand words. In addition to numbers and data, add life to your reports and messaging with photos. We&#8217;ve found that photos are the most effective way to solicit <a title=\"employee recognition\" href=\"http://www.wespire.com/why-employee-recognition-may-be-as-easy-as-uploading-a-picture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feedback</a> and serve as a great way to contextualize and showcase your employees in action.</li>\n<li><strong>Repurpose content into digestible pieces</strong>: Not everyone has the time to sit down and read a long report. Instead, infographics are a great way to broaden your audience, and highlight key statistics though bite-size, approachable content.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>One Last Step: Reuse Your Data to Drive Further Success</h3>\n<p>Lastly, don&#8217;t forget to use this information to learn about what <a title=\"motivate employees\" href=\"http://www.wespire.com/how-to-drive-employee-engagement-find-out-what-motivates-your-employees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">motivates</a> your employees, and drive further impact.
