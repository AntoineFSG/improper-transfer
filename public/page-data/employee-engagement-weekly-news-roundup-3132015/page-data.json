For a frame of reference, in January the average was 31.7%. While the increase is a very encouraging sign, the majority of workers in the U.S. are still not engaged. Gallup estimates that this slight uptick can be attributed to improvements in unemployment and underemployment.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"Why Wellness Programs Are Key to Your Company's Health\" href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/2893976/careers-staffing/why-wellness-programs-are-key-to-your-company-s-health.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Wellness Programs Are Key to Your Company&#8217;s Health</a></h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s becoming more common for companies to host employer-sponsored wellness programs in order to reduce healthcare costs, however these programs can also be an effective way to increase productivity, engagement, and talent management efforts. The author encourages organizations to explore wellness programs that can integrate and simplify the benefits for employees and make them easily accessible and personalized&#8217;technology platform systems offer a creative and easy-to-manage way of doing this.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"The Growing Importance of Managers in Employee Engagement\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gail-s-thornton/the-growing-importance-of_1_b_6775364.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Growing Importance of Managers in Employee Engagement</a></h3>\n<p>When companies talk about &#8220;internal communications&#8221; or &#8220;employee engagement&#8221; there are usually two high-level goals they want employees to achieve in their work: 1) develop a sense of purpose in their role and 2) passionately follow through every day on that sense of purpose. Employee engagement is an investment and the return is commitment and motivation from employees. The best way to do this? Connect employees with their colleagues, and perhaps more importantly, connect them to their direct-line supervisors who can provide the challenge, connection to their role, and support through conversation to help employees develop their sense of purpose in the company.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"CSR Programs Are Not The Answer\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardlawler/2015/03/10/csr-programs-are-not-the-answer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CSR Programs Are Not The Answer</a></h3>\n<p>Despite the controversial title, the author emphasizes that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs alone do not achieve a big enough impact to justify corporate investment. Instead, organizations need to focus on performing well financially, socially, environmentally, and in how they impact their employees. The way many CSR programs are currently set up does not warrant the execution or measurement of these four critical quadruple bottom line areas. In addition to modifying how publicly they report their results, organizations should be using results to guide future decision-making at all levels of operation. Only then will CSR programs be as effective as possible.</p>\n<h3><a title=\"5 Ways to Keep Employees Inspired and in Love With Their Jobs\" href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/243685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 Ways to Keep Employees Inspired and in Love With Their Jobs</a></h3>\n<p>Inspiring your employees may seem like an abstract idea, however uninspired employees tend to bend the rules, drag their feet on assignments, and try to spend the least amount of time possible at the office. Keeping employees engaged and inspired is necessary for them to produce their best work and remain satisfied in their role. The author recommends creating an inspiring environment, bringing in industry leaders to speak with them, show monetary results, offer incentives, and most importantly, communicating openly and frequently with them.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\"  wp-image-335 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire blog image\" width=\"175\" height=\"62\" /></a>Visit the <a href=\"/blog\">WeSpire blog</a> and subscribe to get the latest employee engagement articles delivered straight into your inbox.</p></blockquote>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-weekly-news-roundup-3132015","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f741ad15-240e-5e1f-b48e-75dd55f68337"}}}
