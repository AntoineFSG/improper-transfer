The event brought together leaders across the energy intelligence and technology communities for three full days of in-depth discussions, networking and predictions for the future. As the organizers promised, attendees walked away with enhanced knowledge of how energy intelligence is reshaping energy management, as well as best practices for organizations looking to building employee engagement around maximizing operational efficiency, increasing productivity and improving financial benefits.<br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h3>Finding Balance in Competing Interests</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights of the event for me was certainly my panel discussion, Ask the Experts: Corporate Sustainability, where I spoke alongside Balaji Jayaseelan, Sr. Manager of Global Environment and Sustainability at Newell Rubbermaid, Nils Kok, CEO and co-founder of GRESB, Allison Porter, VP of Sustainability Services at DTZ, and Michael Winkler, Director of the Office of Energy and Sustainability at Yeshiva University. Not only were we able to engage in conversation with each other, but we were able to interact with the audience around how investments in sustainability can be both financially- and environmentally- beneficial for their organizations. As panelists, we shared how we&#8217;ve set and achieved sustainability goals (or in WeSpire&#8217;s case, helped others meet their goals!) that contribute to strong triple bottom-line performance.</p>\n<h3>Current Themes in Building Sustainability into Employee Engagement</h3>\n<p>Beyond my panel discussion, there were a few key themes that were echoed throughout the sessions and by attendees:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Innovative Software</strong>: Companies like EnerNOC are creating innovative software that can measure energy in complex and detailed ways, but during the conference it was clear that we&#8217;re also entering a period where individual and company behavior around energy management and tracking is getting some serious attention.</li>\n<li><strong>Intelligent Technology</strong>: There were a number of discussions focused on energy intelligence and technology, yet there was a strong connection to energy management and sustainability. It left me thinking: why is the field of energy management merging with sustainability? Previously, I don&#8217;t think many people saw them as related or connected because the financial piece of it (i.e. using energy management to save money) was much more important.</li>\n<li><strong>Measuring Savings Impact</strong>: We&#8217;ve finally moved beyond just tracking and measuring energy into a time where companies are forced to be much more strategic. Companies are saying: &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to just understand how much money we currently spend on energy and how we can save more, we want to understand how our savings impact the environment and what measures can still be improved.&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Changing Attitudes &amp; Behavior</strong>: The most difficult part of merging energy management and sustainability strategy may be getting people onboard with the new technology, to not only adapt to it but thrive with it and change their behavior in positive ways. Fortunately, behavior change technologies&#8217;such as the WeSpire platform&#8217;offer a solution for this problem. And for that, I am very excited and optimistic that industries like energy management can lead the way for improved sustainability engagement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Did you attend the EnerNOC EnergySMART Conference this year?
