But for a global corporation like the Kellogg Company, Food is serious business, subject to the vagaries of economic market pressures, political circumstances, health issues, extreme weather conditions&#8217;and the common denominator is the people involved.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nWe spoke with <a href=\"http://www.kelloggs.com/en_US/environmental-initatives.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kellogg&#8217;s</a> <em>Chief Sustainability Officer</em>, Diane Holdorf, to learn more.<br />\nMost important is to understand what is most material for the business you are in. There&#8217;s a lot of stuff, a lot of noise. Don&#8217;t let it distract you from what&#8217;s most important. The needs and the risks of your company are actually going to be quite particular, and they are actually quite immense! Identify the biggest areas of concern and risk. That way, now you&#8217;re creating opportunities that are meaningful, and that the business can rally around. People can say, <em>Yes, this makes sense to me. I can work on that. I <strong>want</strong> to work on that</em>.<br />\nHoldorf explains that company history guides the strategy today:<br />\nMuch of this is grounded with our founder, Will Keith Kellogg, in 1906. <strong>He was deeply committed to people, and to environmental conservation</strong>. His values and beliefs resonate with us today. As well, she explains that Kellogg&#8217;s approach is robust, <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kellogg-company-demonstrates-commitment-to-sustainability-climate-smart-agriculture-training-and-best-practices-during-cop21--a-global-conference-on-climate-change-300187718.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">science-based</a>: we can speak to our plan with assurance.<br />\nOur CEO&#8217;s leadership is essential. He was willing to spend three days at the Climate talks in Paris in December, and that sent really strong signals. One is, this is Business Critical. With the ongoing impact of climate change, there&#8217;s a food-supply continuity risk that we have to be planning for around the world. Equally important, consumers care about these issues. More and more they want to buy from companies that share their values. It becomes quite obvious that this is an imperative from a business standpoint.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Consumers care about these issues. More and more they want to buy from companies that share their values. It becomes quite obvious that this is an imperative from a business standpoint.</p></blockquote>\n<p>CEO John Bryant announced clear and bold targets:<br />\n&#8220;Kellogg is more than a business. We care about nourishing people with our foods, feeding those in need, nurturing our planet, and living our founder&#8217;s values. People care about their food, where it comes from, the people who grow and make it, and that there&#8217;s enough for everyone. &#8216; We recognize the interconnected and inter-reliant nature of our business with suppliers, farmers, customers, consumers, and governments.&#8221;<br />\nTo illustrate how this philosophy works on the ground, Holdorf offers the high-protein grain <em>chenopodium</em>, aka Quinoa:<br />\nWe added quinoa to Special K Nourish in 2013. We found a source in Bolivia, and we began partnering with high-plateau quinoa farming communities there. <strong>At the time, there was nobody working with the farmers on a local level, so we created programs to support them.</strong> We identified great need to improve soil health, for example. So we invested in getting them an agronomist who helps them improve yields. Then, we helped provide basic financial understanding for these small businesses. We partnered with <a href=\"http://www.rootcapital.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Root Capital</a> to provide basics, think of it as Finance 101. Later, as we visited their communities again, we realized they badly need reliable electricity, so we partnered to bring them solar power. These farmers understand that their weather patterns are changing &#8212; they use the term climate change. They developed targeted irrigation programs to reduce the risk of yields. And the solar electricity has other benefits, too. Now their kids can study at home at night. Women can do what they need to do after the sun falls. So an entire cascade rippled through in these communities. <strong>This has made a huge difference in the lives of these farmers.</strong><br />\n<strong>Food industry leaders are working at the macro and micro level around the world to hit their business goals, which include improving lives in the communities where they work. As always, the approach depends on the business and corporate culture &#8216; and on the people who make the company run.</strong></p>\n","slug":"food-legacy-business-critical","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"6ac40ded-8d5b-5457-84fe-c8c7e12b4cbe"}}}
