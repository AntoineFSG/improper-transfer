We were lucky enough to be assigned to Boston&#8217;s historic Fenway Park. Greenovate provided the volunteers with the necessary tools: trash bags, trash pickers, brooms, rakes, gloves &#8212; you name it, they had it.<br />\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1635 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CgqgzJHU8AAb18A.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteer\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /><br />\nWe were lucky to have such beautiful weather on our volunteer day, but that wasn&#8217;t the only highlight of the day. Here are the five best parts of our volunteer day &#8216; and why it won&#8217;t be our last!<br />\n<strong>1. It boosted morale:</strong> Everyone had looked forward to a switch in routine, a chance to get out of the office and into the community. WeSpire helps companies connect their employees to their purpose, and this was a good reminder that we need to do the same at our organization.<br />\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">2. Team building:</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> We had volunteers from marketing, engineering and customer success working together and getting to know each other. It was a great opportunity to learn about each others&#8217; interests and collaborate in a completely new setting.</span><br />\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">3. It&#8217;s part of our purpose:</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> We help companies improve employee engagement and drive positive actions. We embrace any opportunity we can to further support our mission.</span><br />\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">4. Networking:</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> In addition to working with people from various WeSpire departments, we had a few volunteers from other companies join our group. Talking with them about their jobs and why they decided to volunteer helped us to gain new perspectives and exchange ideas.</span><br />\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">5. Impact:</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> We know that every action counts, no matter how small, it can have a real impact on the world. Having the opportunity volunteer with my colleagues is a reminder of the positive impact that corporations can have in our communities.</span><br />\n<em>What are some of your employees&#8217; favorite volunteer opportunities? We&#8217;d love to hear how your team celebrated Earth Day.</em></p>\n","slug":"5-reasons-volunteering-boosts-engagement","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"114db5e8-9f32-5aa3-93dd-dfc94c720bd0"}}}
