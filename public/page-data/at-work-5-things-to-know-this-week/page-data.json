Some of whom we work with. And others we wish we did.</em><br />\n<!--more--></p>\n<h2><strong>Quotes from Work</strong></h2>\n<p>I think the most important thing that corporate America has found is that <strong>they need their employees to perform. They understand that engagement is absolutely essential to their productivity</strong>.<br />\nChristine Lawson, SVP Kimpton Hotels &amp; Restaurants, in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/business/hotels-company-retreats.html\">The New York Times</a> on Tuesday.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Actions at Work</strong></h2>\n<p>Levi Strauss &amp; Co. sells mountains of jeans around the world every day. Ten years ago they started looking closely at the efficiencies relating to their manufacturing and distribution operations, and they&#8217;ve made astounding progress. An example this week: Levi&#8217;s vast distribution center near Las Vegas, which has been retrofitted and upgraded to award-winning LEED excellence. The success is all about thoughtful planning, enlightened leadership, execution, design, and investment. But that&#8217;s not all. According to Levi&#8217;s VP Michael Kobori, <strong>employee enthusiasm</strong> is a key component:<br />\n<strong>Smaller initiatives, like having employees bring their used batteries from home to recycle at work, were a driving force</strong> for Levi&#8217;s sustainability accomplishments, <a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/levi-strauss-distribution-center-honored-sustainability\">Kobori said</a>.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Passion at Work</strong></h2>\n<p>You don&#8217;t usually string the words <em>female, vegan, race-car driver</em>, and <em>product innovation</em> together, but that&#8217;s what happened when Leilani Munter requested vegan seats for her Tesla. Results! Faux-leather seats are in the works.<br />\nAutomakers like BMW, Toyota, Ford, and Chevy also get the demand for environmentally friendly components: <strong>All the car companies want sustainability cred</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/automobiles/from-tesla-a-new-car-smell-that-vegans-can-get-behind.html\">says Jack Nerad</a>, executive editorial director at Kelley Blue Book.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Moving and Improving Work</strong></h2>\n<p>CEO Jeff Immelt on GE headquarters&#8217; move to Boston, announced this week:<br />\n&#8220;Greater Boston is home to 55 colleges and universities. Massachusetts spends more on research development than any other region in the world, and Boston attracts a diverse, technologically-fluent workforce focused on solving challenges for the world,&#8221; he said <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/13/general-electric-to-select-boston-as-new-global-headquarters-report.html\">on CNBC</a>. &#8220;We are excited to bring our headquarters to this dynamic and creative city.&#8221;<br />\nYou want to be someplace where people support job creation, where it&#8217;s attractive to talent, good cost of living, and that is very supportive of what a high-tech exporter has to be all about,&#8221; he said.<br />\n<strong>Bonus Tip for Work</strong><br />\nImmelt: &#8220;<strong>To be a leader it helps if you actually like people.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>FOR THE WEEKEND</strong></h2>\n<p>One thrilling aspect of working with a team of brilliant tech innovators is that they are always, well, brilliantly innovating with the persuasive technology we have created here at WeSpire. Our colleague Tim Noetzel is currently working on a coaching app for Managers, and he&#8217;d love a few Alpha users to kick the tires and provide feedback.<br />\n<em>Interested in providing input for the next best big thing in employee engagement?
