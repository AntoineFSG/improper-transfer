Since 1987, these prestigious awards honor the best innovative new products and services around the globe, and celebrate the persistence and excellence personified by the man they were named after &#8216; Thomas Edison.<br />\nAs a finalist in the <strong>Innovative Services &#8211; Workplace Resources</strong> category, we&#8217;re honored to see WeSpire&#8217;s unique behavior change technology being recognized as a positive influence in the workforce. As any business leader will tell you, employee engagement is becoming increasingly more difficult in today&#8217;s always-on, connected world where it&#8217;s harder than ever to ensure people are focused, empowered and engaged. In fact, the number of engaged employees worldwide is currently at a record low &#8216; just 13 percent according to <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gallup</a>. In the U.S. alone, this equates to a loss of $450-550 billion each year.<br />\nThe <span style=\"color: #000080;\">WeSpire Behavioral Project Library</span> is the first solution of its kind, offering organizations a collection of prebuilt employee engagement programs in areas that align with corporate initiatives. The Library content spans a number of areas including sustainability, social responsibility, well-being and volunteering. The pre-designed programs in the library can easily be customized and branded for each organization. The modules are designed to motivate and empower employees, based on scientifically proven principles of behavior change, e.g.,</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Relevant Timing</strong>:</span> Content is delivered when an employee perceives a need that they can personally identify with (e.g. a recycling program around Earth Day)</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Actionable Content</strong>:</span> Content is simple, focused and instructs the user on how to take action</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Variety and Intrigue</strong>:</span> Employees are prompted with intended actions that are enticing and elicit curiosity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to providing actionable projects, the WeSpire platform produces reports on employee participation and impact. The analytics engine provides a robust view of how employees are engaging with corporate directives and interacting with their fellow employees to bring about impactful, long-term change.<br />\nEveryone on the WeSpire team has contributed to the development of the Behavioral Project Library, and we are taking a moment to celebrate. With the awards gala coming up in April, we hope you will be cheering us on, as we aim to bring home the gold!</p>\n","slug":"wespire-is-a-finalist-in-the-2016-edison-awards","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"6a54b889-0d87-5681-93cc-274b79cedff6"}}}
