While the 7-minute workout is not designed to completely replace your daily recommended activity, work by <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">scientists</a> at McMaster University, and other institutions shows, that even a few minutes of training at an intensity approaching your maximum capacity produces molecular changes within muscles comparable to those of several hours of running or bike riding.<br />\nHere at WeSpire, we&#8217;ve created an employee engagement program around the 7-minute workout. Every day at 1:45, whoever is free and interested is welcome to join a group of us in a conference rooms for our 7-minute high intensity workout. Here are four benefits that we&#8217;ve seen from starting our new employee engagement program!<br />\n<strong>1.</strong><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong> It promotes a positive culture. </strong></span>At WeSpire, employees are empowered to speak up and share new ideas. The idea for a 7-minute company-wide workout break was introduced by a team member &#8216; not a company leader. Often your best, employee engagement programs are built from the bottom up, so let your employees do the work and come to you with unique ideas!<br />\n<strong>2.</strong> A positive culture creates a positive team, which <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>boosts team morale.</strong></span> Given our very busy and <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/10-things-millennials-look-for-in-an-employer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">flexible schedules</a>, our small team doesn&#8217;t always have the chance to meet in a social setting all that often. Our workout gives us an excuse to come together and connect for at least 7-minutes on any given day. It&#8217;s the perfect way to catch-up and de-stress from anything going on during our workdays. Admittedly, the de-stressing often comes from our laughter as we all <u>attempt</u> the new exercises.<br />\n<strong>3.</strong> We&#8217;ve found that once the endorphins are flowing, and moods have been boosted, <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>employees are more productive. </strong></span>We&#8217;ve all experienced the mid-day slump at one time or another. It&#8217;s usually when you start to see employees leaving the office for a coffee break &#8216; but offering a scheduled wellness program is an excellent way to get employees to not only stay in the office, but gain their second wind. Working out can also help with mental clarity. <a href=\"http://www.active.com/fitness/articles/how-exercise-boosts-your-brainpower\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boosting your heart rate</a> decreases stress, and increases brain activity. This much needed break helps your employees head back to their desks energized and ready for the second half of their day.<br />\n<strong>4.</strong> Healthier, happier employees can <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>lower health care costs. </strong></span>A recent study done by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/aag/pdf/2015/aag-workplace-health.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CDC found</a> that productivity losses linked to unhealthy employees, who miss work, cost employers $225.8 billion, or $1,685 per employee, each year. Further, even a 1% reduction in excess weight and high blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol levels has been shown to save $83 to $103 annually in medical costs per person. Just by offering employees this simple yet effective wellness program could save your company hundreds, if not millions.<br />\nSo go ahead, try it out, and see for yourself!<br />\n<em>Does your company offer something similar; we&#8217;re always interested in hearing new ideas &#8216; share with us in the comments. </em></p>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-program-idea-from-our-office-to-yours","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"b9161004-8bdb-509e-84fa-b41347e70dc8"}}}
