Each organization was scored on four universal KPI&#8217;s: leadership diversity, clean capitalism pay link, pension fund status, and percentage of taxes paid.<br />\nAdditional criteria were based on KPI&#8217;s for each organization&#8217;s respective GISC industry and included productivity and safety metrics, employee turnover rates, R&amp;D investments, and more.<br />\nAmong the top 100 companies is worldwide leader in IT, Cisco, which ranked number 3, British multinational retailer, Marks &amp; Spencer, and British multinational alcoholic beverage company, Diageo. See how these leading organizations landed on Corporate Knights&#8217; annual Global 100.<br />\n<strong>Cisco</strong><br />\nSkyrocketing from last year&#8217;s 57th position, Cisco is now ranked third on the 2017 Annual Global 100. Since last year, Cisco has hit 100 percent energy productivity, 81 percent waste productivity, has 38 percent of their senior executive positions held by women, and has a remarkable 90 percent ranking for diversity among their leadership team.<br />\nWe can expect to continue to see great things from Cisco.

Sustainable Business Director, Mike Barry comments on their commitment, we&#8217;ve never hesitated to update Plan A, because, after all, change is the only constant of business life. The marketplace changes, leaders change, new issues emerge, new solutions are developed. A business&#8217;s commitment to the long haul of truly sustainable change is constantly being tested and questioned.&#8221;<br />\n<strong>Diageo</strong><br />\nLastly, Diageo, made the list for their impressive score of 98 percent in leadership diversity, 100 percent in safety performance and sustainability pay link, along with a remarkable 45 percent in women-held board positions.<br />\nDiageo is seen as a leader in the alcohol industry, and its commitments to sustainability and responsibility targets are equally impressive. Diageo has worked hard to create a positive role for alcohol in society, which is one of its <a href=\"http://www.diageo.com/en-row/csr/sustainability/Pages/2020-Sustainability-Responsibility-targets.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 sustainability and responsibility targets</a>.
