But how effective is it, really, to engage your employees in environmental sustainability?<!--more--><br />\nA few weeks ago, I sat down with Suz Mac Cormac, a <a href=\"http://www.mofo.com/people/m/mac-cormac-susan-h\">partner</a> in the Corporate Department at <a href=\"http://www.mofo.com/\">Morrison Foerster&#8217;s</a> (self proclaimed, MoFo) San Francisco office, to discuss the internal sustainability committee she started in 2005. Suz had offhandedly mentioned the committee to me about a month ago and I wanted to know more. Here&#8217;s a great story about the positive impact employee engagement programs can have on changing a company.</p>\n<h4><strong>The C-Suite Suppo</strong><strong>rt</strong></h4>\n<p>In 2004, Suz was a Tier 8 Partner&#8217;lowest on the partner totem pole&#8217;but she was young, and had a track record of generating money for the firm. She went around to every Tier 1 partner that she knew, and made the business case for sustainability. I had a lot of charts, and figures, and graphs, she said. She was eventually given a speaking role at the partner retreat later that year.<br />\nSuz knew her audience, and did not want to come across as a tree-hugging Californian speaking to a fairly conservative firm. I was all about the numbers, and about the amount of investment that needed to be made, and infrastructure, and energy. The business case was clear, but she kept throwing in, if we are going to focus on this externally, we need to focus on this internally.</p>\n<h4><strong>Up &amp; Running</strong></h4>\n<p>There was much interest after the partner retreat so she set up an internal sustainability committee made up of attorneys and staff from each of the offices. This was formally launched in 2005. Anyone who wanted to be involved on the committee could be&#8217;even the guy in the mailroom.<br />\nThere were certain people, who took it and ran with it&#8217;you didn&#8217;t know where it would come from, said Suz.<br />\nFor example, the reason they have a web site to drive employee engagement in sustainability is because Tony Hoke, a Sr. Global Sourcing Manager at MoFo, and a couple others in the IT department took it upon on themselves to build it.</p>\n<h4><strong>Execution</strong></h4>\n<p>Co-chaired by Associate, Adam Hunt, and firm-wide Manager of Operations, Peter Elton, the Internal Sustainability Committee (ISC) has calls regularly with a predetermined agenda. They discuss operational inefficiencies, even engaging outside consultants when necessary. Early on, they hired <a href=\"http://www.bsr.org/en/about/bsr\">BSR</a> to do an internal audit, and had them list potential corporate green initiatives as either cost-savings, cost-neutral, or costly. With this information, they were able to make improvements to the point where the SF office became <a href=\"http://www.usgbc.org/leed#certification\">LEED Gold certified</a>. In addition to office improvements, the ISC sets actionable company goals for sustainability issues, such as reducing paper usage. They then communicate and track the initiatives through their employee engagement portal page, Eco-Challenge.<br />\nEco-Challenge encourages participation with gamification, by awarding points to employees who engage in positive actions like bike-to-work week, the EPA&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/conserve/smm/wastewise/about.htm\">WasteWise</a> program, or simply turning the monitor off when not in use. Employees then put those points towards rewards like an eco-bag, or extra votes to decide what non-profit the firm will donate to. Furthermore, Eco-Challenge tracks engagement by office, which has led to friendly competition between offices all over the world and allows the team to measure the success of the program.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Results</strong></h4>\n<p>This year, <a href=\"http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-law-firms-in-each-practice-area/?sRankID=243\">Vault.com</a> ranked MoFo as the #1 law firm in CleanTech/Renewable Energy and Technology. According to Suz, the reason they can do this work is because there is a business for it. The reason they have been so successful is a result of the sustainability committee getting people excited and knowledgeable about the corporate green initiatives. RFP wise, MoFo is able to provide legal service to clients with even the most robust questions on internal environmental sustainability&#8217; <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/pages/jpmorgan\">JP Morgan</a> is one of these.<br />\nSuz went on to point out that driving employee engagement in sustainability has had been beneficial for the firm on the employee acquisition and retention front, recognizing the platform as a driver for more of the best and brightest to want to come work for the law firm. When I asked her how she knows this, she said, Because they come and ask about it.<br />\nSustainability is such a hit at MoFo that posted on the front page of the main company portal is a big green leaf with the green tip of the day.<br />\n&#8220;Have <em>you</em> turned off your monitor today?&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><a href=\"/demo\"><img class=\"  alignleft wp-image-128\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fp-featured-content-img-300x152.png\" alt=\"demo employee engagement platform for corporate green initiatives\" width=\"158\" height=\"80\" /></a><a title=\"demo\" href=\"/demo\">Request a demo today</a> to find out how WeSpire&#8217;s employee engagement platform can help your business take action on corporate green initiatives and attract and retain the brightest talent.</em></p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<em>Susan Mac Cormac is a partner in the Corporate Department of Morrison &amp; Foerster&#8217;s San Francisco office.
