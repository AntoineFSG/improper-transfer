According to a report from 2013, <strong>80% of Americans agree that receiving gratitude makes them work harder, but only 10% admitted to expressing gratitude to others every day</strong>. However, showing appreciation via financial reward can often lead to only short-term satisfaction, versus long-term fulfillment. The author suggests being sincere and specific in thanking others for their work and contribution.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kateharrison/2015/08/08/7-lessons-from-a-successful-corporate-social-responsibility-program/\">7 Lessons From A Successful Corporate Social Responsibility Program</a></h3>\n<p>While more and more companies boast having CSR programs, the majority struggle to tie their program to their existing culture and organizational values. Ryan McCarty, director of customer and employee relations at TCC and leader of one of the most impressive CSR programs in the country, shares 7 best practices, such as following your employee&#8217;s interests, getting customers involved, and getting regular feedback.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://labs.openviewpartners.com/how-to-empower-your-employees/\">How to Empower Your Employees &amp; Provide Opportunities for Growth</a></h3>\n<p>As workplaces modernize, employees expect and demand that employers provide opportunities for empowerment and personal growth. WeSpire&#8217;s CEO &amp; Founder, Susan Hunt Stevens shares how companies can better demonstrate the important roles of purpose, positive impact and great managers in driving engagement: 1) Implement tools that improve the work experience, 2) Make it social, and 3) Don&#8217;t overlook individual passions.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3049665/the-future-of-work/hr-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it\">HR is Broken. Here&#8217;s How to Fix It.</a></h3>\n<p>Traditional HR views people as assets, and as the industry and business has evolved, many departments are often forced by their own mandate to act merely as policy enforcers of those assets. The author urges HR professionals to reimagine themselves as consultants on organizational structure and the best way to do that is to <strong>get smarter at using technology and data</strong>: There are countless ways data can be used to predict performance and outcomes.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/changing-game-employee-engagement-linkedins-hackathon-pat-wadors\">Changing the Game for Employee Engagement: LinkedIn&#8217;s Non-Technical Hackathon</a></h3>\n<p>Leave it to LinkedIn to set a trend that is likely to take off in organizations across the world: a non-technical 24-hour, Engagement themed contest to move the needle, spark imagination around talent engagement, and heighten the awareness/cool factor of HR. 150 interns from companies across the Bay Area participated and were challenged to create a 3-min pitch for an innovative idea that addresses a business challenge or opportunity related to the theme of employee engagement. (Cool! Can we all be interns again??)</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\"  wp-image-335 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire blog image\" width=\"175\" height=\"62\" /></a>Visit the <a href=\"/blog\">WeSpire blog</a> and subscribe to get the latest employee engagement articles delivered straight into your inbox.</p></blockquote>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-weekly-news-roundup-8142015","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"87e5ba4f-37e7-5d08-b941-5546805251c7"}}}
