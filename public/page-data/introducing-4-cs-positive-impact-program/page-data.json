When executed successfully, these programs are good for society, external stakeholders, employees and the bottom line.<br />\nBut these programs don&#8217;t come without their potential pitfalls:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accusations of being just for marketing purposes</li>\n<li>Lack of employee awareness</li>\n<li>Low participation rates</li>\n<li>Limited resources</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We get it. Our <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/customer-success/\">customer success team</a> is working side-by-side every day with some of the world&#8217;s most innovative companies to avoid and resolve these challenges. Working in the trenches, we&#8217;ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to positive impact programs, and have just the tool to help you succeed.</p>\n<h3>About the Four C&#8217;s Framework</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/4-cs-positive-impact-programs/\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2112\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/COMMIT-1-300x300.png\" alt=\"4 C's Graphic\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />The Four C&#8217;s of a Positive Impact Program</a> framework builds off of the work that we do every day with our clients, explaining the four necessary pillars of any successful positive impact program.<br />\nThere&#8217;s no right place to start, it&#8217;s all based on your business or business unit&#8217;s strengths and capabilities. You may have one or two of these C&#8217;s already figured out but need to improve on the other two. Maybe you&#8217;re still working on getting all four of the C&#8217;s in place. In that case, start with the one that you think seems most manageable and go from there.</p>\n<h4><em>We will continue to release additional resources and tools related to the Four C&#8217;s of a Positive Impact program, and look forward to hearing about the programs you develop with this framework.</em></h4>\n","slug":"introducing-4-cs-positive-impact-program","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"574a7ef5-a31f-5f89-911f-226d6b1f5690"}}}
