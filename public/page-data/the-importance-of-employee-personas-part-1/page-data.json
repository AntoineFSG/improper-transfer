Now, cutting edge HR organizations are developing employee personas.<!--more--><br />\n<a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-definition-under-100-sr#sm.0000lh2d8o1e3gd9hvn64axac0ko6\">HubSpot defines a buyer persona</a> as, a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer based on market research and real data about your existing customers.<br />\nSales and marketing use these personas to help guide every decision from logos and taglines to what content is written and discussed by the brand. Creating personas encourages companies to visualize real people and problems and better determine how to effectively engage them.<br />\nToday, we&#8217;re seeing more and more human resource organizations develop employee personas to help them with their planning and decision making, and it makes perfect sense. Here are three big benefits of employee personas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Hiring:</strong> This is the most common use case for employee personas. With personas HR can go beyond job history to describe what their ideal candidate would look like, and create the right materials to attract the candidates that fit this persona. Once an employee persona is fully developed HR can create a targeted recruiting strategy that takes into consideration where they might find the ideal employee and what will interest and appeal to them to talk with the hiring company.</li>\n<li><strong>Employee engagement program development:</strong> Beyond recruitment, employee personas can provide high level clarity into the makeup of your workforce and help you to develop various <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/tag/employee-engagement-programs/\">employee engagement programs </a>that appeal to each of the personas. It&#8217;s impossible to develop an employee engagement program for each individual, but using employee personas can keep you focused when creating these programs and ensure that you&#8217;re developing programs with your workforce in mind.</li>\n<li><strong>Internal communications:</strong> Once you&#8217;ve developed these programs your employee personas will be a huge help to create your internal communication plan. What aspects of the program will each persona most care about? What personas use the intranet, and which are more likely to read the flyers in public spaces? Having these answers at the ready will help you to created a strategic communication plan for each employee engagement program based on the employee persona it was developed in mind for.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Next week we&#8217;ll dive into how to start thinking about, and creating employee personas. Stay tuned!</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Is your company using employee personas?
