From the start-up community’s #Founders4Change initiative to the 400 CEO’s who have signed the </span><a href=\"https://www.ceoaction.com/pledge/ceo-pledge/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion pledge</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it’s fair to say that “Intent” to act is high. In terms of importance, Deloitte’s </span><a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends/2017/diversity-and-inclusion-at-the-workplace.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">human capital trends survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2017 also noted that inclusion as a top priority is up 32% versus 2014. </span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what is happening in terms of action? It’s more of a mixed bag. From the positive, the number of all-male management teams has dropped from 33% to 25% since 2017. However, the number of total women in senior roles has actually declined globally by 1% from 25% to 24%. It was </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/upshot/fewer-women-run-big-companies-than-men-named-john.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also noted </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that there are still fewer Fortune 500 CEOs who are women (4.1%) than who are named David (4.5%) or John (5.3%).</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we’ve learned through </span><a href=\"https://www.wespire.com/solutions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our diversity work</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with customers is that they often know data about “what”, but not “why.”  They know that 15% of leaders are women, but they don’t know what the women or under-represented minorities who succeeded had in common, either with each other or their majority colleagues. They don’t know what about the demographic, situational or behavioral/cultural factors had a positive or negative impact on successful outcomes. To uncover these factors, we’ve refined a methodology that helps companies learn what the statistically significant factors for success are. We are excited to share an example of what we have learned working with one of the world’s leading consulting companies in a webinar at 12pm on November 20th.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are struggling to hit your diversity goals despite following most, if not all of the best practices, this methodology could be a key to success in 2019.  We look forward to sharing it with you. <strong><a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/yasng76y\">Sign up here.</a></strong></span></p>\n","slug":"diversity-success-methodology","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"98aa7ee7-3107-5ccc-bc05-cf159c4e06bd"}}}
