Our Founder and CEO, Susan Hunt Stevens, discussed how today&#8217;s organizations are utilizing the latest in social technologies for sustainability and CSR employee engagement.</p>\n<h4>Today&#8217;s Socially Empowered Engagement</h4>\n<p>Susan spoke firsthand about how to encourage positive behavior change through targeted content, and social and game mechanics. Coupled with mobile technology, today&#8217;s businesses and their workforce can benefit from the combined positive impact of sustainability and CSR employee engagement programs (see our <a href=\"/resource/workplace-sustainability-online-driving-impact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">case study</a> on Sony Electronics).</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the heart of this success is behavioral science, which is why we are thrilled to be in attendance and speaking at <a href=\"http://beccconference.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BECC</a> this week.</p></blockquote>\n<h4>The Data Behind the Combined Benefits of Diversity</h4>\n<p>Our findings indicate that <strong>engagement rates are 10 percentage points higher in programs that include both CSR and sustainability</strong>. The logic behind this is somewhat intuitive: programs that offer both sustainability and CSR projects attract a more diverse employee base. While there are some employees who care deeply about the environment and sustainability, there are likely a significant portion of the workforce that cares more about social programs like volunteering and well-being.<br />\nA platform that has both social and environmental projects is therefore able to draw in a larger crowd, resulting in higher employee engagement in your corporate program and mission.<br />\n<img class=\" aligncenter\" title=\"Average 30-Day Engagement\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/217956/file-2200627088-png/Sustainabilit_+_CSR_graph-1.png?t=1423778295545\" alt=\"Average 30-Day Engagement\" /><br />\nBut what if you still only care about the environmental impacts? You could hypothesize that CSR employee engagement projects, like volunteering and giving, could serve as a distraction, and potentially take away from your environmental goals. Knowing this could be a concern, we dug into the data and found the exact opposite. <strong>Users on platforms with visibility into both sustainability and CSR employee engagement projects completed an average of 1.7 more actions in environmentally-focused projects. </strong><br />\nThese findings also complement other outside research. In particular, a 2013 <a href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/IJPPM-03-2013-0033\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study</a> found that companies that take a holistic CSR approach that includes both environmental and social endeavors reap greater financial returns in the long run.</p>\n<h4>Making a Sustainable Impact Through Positive Behavior Change</h4>\n<p>So what are the key takeaways from our analysis? Programs that include sustainability and CSR have:<br />\n1.  <strong>Higher overall engagement</strong>: Engagement rates are 10 percentage points higher in programs that have both CSR and sustainability projects.<br />\n2. <strong>Higher engagement in sustainability</strong>: Users on platforms with both CSR and sustainability projects completed 1.7 more actions in environmentally-focused projects.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"p3\"><em><img class=\"  alignleft wp-image-277\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SEL-Case-Study-LP-Image-for-website-225x300.png\" alt=\"Sustainability and CSR behavior change at Sony Electronics\" width=\"101\" height=\"134\" />Download our <a href=\"/resource/workplace-sustainability-online-driving-impact\">Sony Electronics case study</a> to learn more about positive behavior change and the benefits of CSR and sustainability programs with WeSpire&#8217;s employee engagement platform.</em></div>\n</blockquote>\n","slug":"csr-sustainability-behavior-change-that-works","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"857380a3-8d47-5024-bc8b-6dedf5163b60"}}}
