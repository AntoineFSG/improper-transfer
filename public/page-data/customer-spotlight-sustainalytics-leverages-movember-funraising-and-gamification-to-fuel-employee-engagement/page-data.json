Our platform&#8217;s built-in game mechanics, social norming, and playful content infuses lightheartedness into our customers&#8217; sustainability, well-being, and civic-service programs; programs that have historically been typecast as un-sexy or boring.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\n<strong>Sustainalytics&#8217; Secret Sauce: FUNraising with Mo Sustainalytics</strong><br />\nOne of our customers, Sustainalytics, is walking the walk when it comes to injecting fun into their engagement programs. Sustainalytics is a global environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment research firm. Branded as Get Your Green On, their WeSpire platform launched in 2014. In the first week, over 92% of employees had joined the platform!<br />\nSustainalytics kicked things off with Movember and Mo Sustainalytics. Movember is a yearly event involving the growth of mustaches for the duration of November to raise funds and awareness for health issues that commonly afflict men like: prostate and testicular cancer, poor mental health, and physical inactivity. Enthusiastic to support such a fun cause, WeSpire worked with Sustainalytics to create a project incorporating a range of Movember-related actions: &#8220;Donate to the Mo Sustainalytics team,&#8221; &#8220;Schedule an annual check-up,&#8221; and of course, &#8220;Show off your &#8216;stache.&#8221;<br />\nMo Sustainalytics was so popular among employees that the team brought it back in 2015.</p>\n<h2>Here&#8217;s the step-by-step process of how the WeSpire Customer Success team worked with Sustainalytics to make the project both impactful and fun.</h2>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Project Kickoff &#8216; Marrying Causes to Build Momentum</strong><br />\nThe project originated via long-term Movember supporter Jean- Francois, from the Sustainalytics Toronto office. Jean-Francois proposed the &#8220;Mo Sustainalytics&#8221; project idea to the firm&#8217;s Sustainability Working Group, and everyone agreed it was a fantastic idea. They were right! It worked!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sustainalytics&#8217; employee base is already highly educated when it comes to sustainability, so the personal well-being and charity aspect of the project had a fresh edge.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mo1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1345\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mo1.png\" alt=\"Mo Sustainalytics\" width=\"732\" height=\"747\" /></a><br />\n<strong>Step 2: Onboarding</strong><br />\nOur favorite part of the project was seeing how the entire company got involved. Men often participate by growing and grooming their moustaches, but contrary to popular belief both Mo Bros and Mo Sistas can participate. The Mo Sustainalytics team was made up of men and women from offices in Toronto, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Timisoara, and Singapore. From facial hair to phone-case decorations to baby bibs &#8216; staches were November&#8217;s trendy and ubiquitous accessory at Sustainalytics.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mo.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1344\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mo.png\" alt=\"Mo Sustainalytics\" width=\"882\" height=\"207\" /></a><br />\n<strong>Step 3: Gamifying &amp; Rewarding</strong><br />\nEach time a user completes an action in any WeSpire project, they earn points tied to that action. Once a user completes enough actions to pass that project&#8217;s point threshold, the user unlocks that project&#8217;s achievement, which is then broadcasted to the platform newsfeed for all to see. So, as employees take actions, they increase their personal rank on the company leaderboard and are publicly recognized for their positive impact. These intrinsic game mechanics fuel a culture of friendly competition and team-bonding.<br />\nOffline, Sustainalytics also offered their most enthusiastic employee a 100 Euro voucher towards Marie-Stella-Maris body care products. <a href=\"https://www.marie-stella-maris.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marie-Stella-Maris</a> was developed in 2011 to offer a broad range of water and personal care products while striving to address the issue of water scarcity. For each product purchased, Marie-Stella-Maris donates to clean drinking water projects worldwide, which aligns with Sustainalytics&#8217; vision of a more just and sustainable global economy. Nice!<br />\n<strong>Step 4: Measuring Success</strong><br />\nMeasuring positive impact is ultimately what this is all about. Thanks to humorous content and compelling incentives, this FUNraising effort was a booming success:<br />\n<strong>182 positive actions completed<br />\n110 photos of mustaches<br />\n$594 raised for charities that support men&#8217;s health<br />\n15% of Sustainalytics employees completed the entire project<br />\n</strong><br />\nThe WeSpire team is thrilled with the success and impact Sustainalytics has had through their Movemeber project. We look forward to our continued collaboration and know we can help make the project even more fun and successful next year!<br />\n<em>Is fun a consideration for your organization&#8217;s engagement program?
