Sustainability is impacting every area of business from recruiting to marketing to finance.<br />\nAnderson and Weizmann have 20 years of experience among them, generating, showing, and demonstrating the business case of sustainability. Each of these experts shared her own best practices on how she&#8217;s been able to beat goals, prove program impacts and savings, and scale their programs across the entire organization.<br />\nFor the first time sustainability is widely understood, and more and more stakeholders know the critical importance of implementing a robust and refined program within their organization. Sustainability is being used to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attract the millennial workforce</li>\n<li>Improve employee engagement scores</li>\n<li>Lower total operating costs</li>\n<li>Increase total revenue</li>\n<li>Improve overall brand value and sentiment within the market</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When posed with the question, Is there an aspect of the business case you know in your heart has a big impact but you you can&#8217;t prove? Anderson explained, <strong>I </strong>know in my heart that a focus on sustainability provides on-the-ground training for the company&#8217;s future leaders. It is a great training and retention tool. I have read a bit of the academic research being done to prove this case, yet I haven&#8217;t been able to succinctly show the value beyond individual anecdotes. Creating great leaders is yet another enormous business benefit that sustainability is delivering to today&#8217;s organizations.<br />\nWe always appreciate any opportunity to further support &amp; work with EnerNOC, an <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/techflash/2014/08/enernoc-makes-strategic-investment-in-wespire-to.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investor</a> and partner of WeSpire&#8217;s. Hunt Stevens explains the unique relationship: &#8220;By pairing WeSpire&#8217;s interactive technology to motivate people with EnerNOC&#8217;s ability to pinpoint the largest opportunities for energy-related savings, organizations can not only get a high return on investment, but improve overall employee engagement metrics, and deliver against broader sustainability goals.&#8221; It&#8217;s a win-win for all.<br />\n<em>What are some of the benefits you&#8217;ve seen from your sustainability programs but haven&#8217;t been able to concretely tie back into your business case?</em></p>\n","slug":"key-takeaways-from-energysmart-2016","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"347cc0ca-48a0-5a70-80fa-33bba33a21ea"}}}
