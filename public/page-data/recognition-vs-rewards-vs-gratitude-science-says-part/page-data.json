While 87% of companies have tenure-based recognition programs and spend 1-2% of payroll (nearly $40B dollars!) on them, the study found they have virtually no impact on organizational performance.  And traditional <a href=\"http://www.leadershipconsulting.com/evidence-based-management-the-science-side-of-motivation.htm\">financial rewards can backfire</a> as well.<br />\nSo what are the best practices for recognition and appreciation programs?  The Bersin study found:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Recognize people for results and specific behaviors</li>\n<li>Enable peer-to-peer recognition because it is more powerful than top-down</li>\n<li>Use storytelling to share why they are being recognized</li>\n<li>Make it easy and frequent</li>\n<li>Tie to company value or goals</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So these are the best ways to design modern, impactful recognition programs, but how does that apply to having a culture of gratitude?  Is there a difference in benefits and outcomes between a recognition program and gratitude/appreciation program?</p>\n<blockquote><p>What do you think?
