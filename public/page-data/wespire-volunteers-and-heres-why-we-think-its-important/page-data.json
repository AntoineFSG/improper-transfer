Cradles to Crayons provides children from birth to age 12, who live in low-income and homeless situations with the essential items they need to thrive at home, at school and at play. All of this work is done for free by engaging and connecting communities that have with communities that need.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nThis organization has no shortage of work for volunteers to do, that&#8217;s for sure. We kicked off our session by matching up shoes of all shapes and sizes and then moved on to putting together packages requested for kids in need. If Kevin asked for a size 3 pair of every day shoes, a hygiene kit, some books for reading, and a winter coat we&#8217;d gather up all of these items, bag them, and make sure his items were ready to be shipped on over. In just two hours our team of 12 was able to put together packages for 149 kids from throughout the Greater Boston area.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In just two hours our team of 12 was able to put together packages for 149 kids from throughout the Greater Boston area.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why Do We Volunteer? </strong><br />\nThere are a lot of reasons but here are a few of them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>We believe in giving back to the community in which we work. </strong>This is baked into nearly all of our company values whether its Put People First, Relationships Matter, We All Need Help; Ask for It or Maintain Perspective and Keep a Sense of Humor one can easily draw a connection from the volunteer work we did yesterday to 4 of our 7 company values we try hard to live and breathe every day at WeSpire.</li>\n<li><strong>It matters to our employees</strong>, the majority of whom are millennials. According to the <a href=\"http://casefoundation.org/resource/millennial-impact-report-2015/?gclid=CLrHgoi_zcoCFU6QHwodUEwB1g\">Millenial Impact Report by the Case Foundation</a> The number one cause-related program that Millennial employees wanted to see more of is company-wide volunteer opportunities.</li>\n<li>We have a lot of work to get done at WeSpire so <strong>we need our team to be supercharged and stick with us.</strong> According to Michael Stroik, manager of research and analytics for CECP in <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3027465/dialed/why-every-company-should-pay-employees-to-volunteer\">Fast Company</a> &#8220;A highly engaged workforce is more likely to exert extra effort and have lower turnover rates, which can be linked to increased output, sales, and profitability.</li>\n<li><strong>Purpose</strong>, so many people are in search of more purpose in their lives, both at work and at home, and volunteering can help. Sherry Hakimi, founder and CEO of organizational development firm Sparktures, had this to say on <a href=\"http://www.greenbiz.com/article/rise-purpose-driven-business\">com</a> Purpose is a key ingredient for a strong, sustainable, scalable organizational culture. It&#8217;s an unseen, yet ever-present element that drives an organization.</li>\n<li><strong>We believe in doing well by doing good</strong> and there are plenty of facts to back that up. The Center for Corporate Citizenship published a research report titled <a href=\"http://ccc.bc.edu/index.cfm?pageId=2928\">The State of Corporate Citizenship 2014</a> where they cited Companies with integrated corporate citizenship programs saw a 2.2x increase in access to new markets and a 2.3x jump in employee retention.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nWe&#8217;d love to hear about your volunteer programs and why they&#8217;re important to your business.
