Now picture a friendly, calming, avuncular drill sergeant. With natty eye glasses. Not much hair. Loves to tell stories.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nA gent, not so much lecturing as <em>confiding</em> in you, from his book-lined study, which may have brightly colored figurines on the jumbly shelves.<br />\nKnow who I&#8217;m talking about?<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/skitch-1.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1460 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/skitch-1-1024x567.png\" alt=\"Seth Godin\" width=\"640\" height=\"354\" /></a><br />\nSeth Godin, of course, best-selling marketing guru, the 21<sup>st</sup> century&#8217;s answer to Socrates. Seth is obsessed, in the best possible way, with Leadership. He is a connoisseur of principles and best practices on the subject, and he wants to share them with you. So you can use them. Starting <em>now</em>.<br />\nAny one of us can join Seth&#8217;s tribe simply by subscribing to his blog, or reading one of his books, cuing him via YouTube or Facebook. If you&#8217;re really committed, you can apply for his <a href=\"https://altmba.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">altMBA</a> program. Which I did, when he first offered it, last summer.<br />\n<strong>I&#8217;m hooked. I receive Seth&#8217;s blog every morning via email&#8217;at 6:17am EST. Sometimes I share it. More often I swallow it like a vitamin and use it as an intention, a welcome foothold during a busy day.</strong><br />\nYou&#8217;ll soon be speaking in Godinese: peppering your presentations with concepts like <a href=\"http://99u.com/videos/5822/seth-godin-quieting-the-lizard-brain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lizard brain</a>; throwing your writer&#8217;s block under the bus where it belongs; whittling your vague impassioned impulses about changing the world into actionable plans that have a shot; and referring to classic Sethisms, e.g., <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/02/a-manifesto-for-small-teams-doing-important-work.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A manifesto for small teams doing important work</a>.<br />\nI believe Seth&#8217;s wish is to create as many leaders as he possibly can, and for a noble reason: to make the world a better place. Despite the <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/304213-the-lizard-brain-is-hungry-scared-angry-and-horny-the\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reptilian inclination</a> to poke successful people until we find their self-serving flaw, I honestly don&#8217;t think Seth does it for the money or the celebrity. He does it because he is very good at it. He is absolutely superb at teaching people to Lead.<br />\nYou will not be shocked that Trust is one of Seth&#8217;s ever-burgeoning principles for Leadership. It&#8217;s pretty amazing to me that he can build solid trust with so many people who honestly don&#8217;t even know how tall he is.<br />\n<strong>1. Earn Trust</strong>.<br />\nThe most important question: <em>Do they trust me enough to believe my promises? </em>Without that, you have nothing&#8217;. Earn trust, earn trust, earn trust. Then you can worry about the rest. (From <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/02/the-most-important-question.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Most Important Question</a>)<br />\n<strong>2. Aim High, aim low, but <em>Aim</em></strong>. Stop looking for unanimous approval. Decide who you need to reach, and focus on them. Don&#8217;t worry about <em>everyone</em>.<br />\n<strong>3. Keep your promises.</strong> Accountability is key. Otherwise how can people follow you? If you say you&#8217;re going to be there at 10, be there at 10. If you guarantee a post every morning, ship it.<br />\n<strong>4. Don&#8217;t forget Rule 6.</strong> Ooooh, how I love Rule 6. Rule 6 is, <em>do not take yourself so damn seriously.</em> Take your goals, your people, your promises seriously. But do not forget to have a sense of humor, or you might turn into an shrill blood-curdler who nobody can stand, much less follow.<br />\n<strong>Bonus:</strong><br />\nPlease close your eyes again, and think of a leader who inspires you.<br />\nTell why. What do they say? How do they think? What do they do, and <em>how do they do it?</em><br />\nHere&#8217;s one: Christiana Figueras. In a <a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/impossible-isnt-a-fact-its-an-attitude-christiana-figueres-at-ted2016/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TED talk this week</a>, she recalls the moment when she decided to lead:<br />\nImpossible is not a fact, it&#8217;s an attitude. I decided, right then and there, that I was going to change my attitude, and I was going to help the world change its attitude on climate change.<br />\nFigueras&#8217;s term ends on July 6<sup>th</sup>. One thing I know for sure: she won&#8217;t let her tribe down: we will all be fascinated to learn what&#8217;s next.<br />\nNow it&#8217;s your turn.<br />\nWho inspires you? And how do they do it?</p>\n","slug":"leadership-at-work-5-pointers-from-professor-godin","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"fd397b3a-fc0c-577d-badc-97974b9f7f3d"}}}
