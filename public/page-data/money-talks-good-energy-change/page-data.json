This is happening all over the place on renewable energy: the cost of using solar power to generate clean electricity has plummeted, by more than 60% since 2009; and the transition to renewable energy is, not surprisingly, happening.<br />\nChief Financial Officers are embracing the change: The scale of the sustainability challenges in the world require bold commitments and bold action, <a href=\"http://www.ceres.org/press/press-releases/major-brand-companies-across-industries-file-legal-brief-supporting-epa2019s-clean-power-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said Rob Olson</a>, CFO IKEA North America. IKEA supports long-lasting, robust policies like the Clean Power Plan, which encourage the innovation needed to grow a low-carbon economy.<br />\nMoney talks.<br />\nScores of major corporations are shifting to clean energy, and not only to hug a tree. We see the compelling financial evidence every day.<br />\nLast week, tech giants Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft organized themselves as the #<a href=\"bit.ly:1SGoXeq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TechAmici</a> in support of clean power; joining IKEA, Mars, Blue Cross Blue Shield MA and Adobe. Why do these corporations support energy-efficient solutions?<br />\nIt is important to the Amici Companies that they reduce their carbon footprints by procuring their electricity from zero- and low-emitting greenhouse gas (GHG) sources, <strong>not only to be good stewards of the environment, but to also because it preserves their economic interests</strong>. (<a href=\"http://business.edf.org/blog/2016/04/01/the-bar-for-corporate-leadership-on-climate-has-been-raised/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">via @EDFbiz</a>)<br />\nTwo weeks ago <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/company/announcements/weve-committed-to-source-100-renewable-electricity-by-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bloomberg</a> expanded its strong commitment to sustainability, joining the RE100 group organized by the Climate Group. The growing roster of <a href=\"http://there100.org/companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RE100</a> members runs from Adobe to Walmart.<br />\nWhy would a competitive media conglomerate like Bloomberg join with other major corporations on a clean-energy vision? Global corporate responsibility, doing the right thing, for sure; but money is the driving factor:<br />\nSourcing renewable electricity enables us to diversify our energy supply, <strong>reduce costs</strong>, provide a hedge against rising traditional <strong>energy costs</strong> and helps contribute to cleaner, healthier communities, Bloomberg&#8217;s Curtis Ravanel explains. RE100 convinced us that they had gathered a strong coalition of committed companies, dedicated to real outcomes. That&#8217;s exciting to us. Collaborating with other companies who are demonstrating that <strong>distributed clean energy makes business sense</strong> will allow all of us to have a greater impact in bringing other companies along.<br />\nManufacturing is in synch: in February, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/business/energy-environment/ge-to-phase-out-cfl-light-bulbs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GE announced</a> it&#8217;s phasing out CFL light bulbs in favor of LEDs, which use 80% less electricity and last for decades. And, which they can sell more of. Again, as you might expect, the decision is financial, driven by price of goods and customer demand.<br />\nAs a result, customers have been migrating toward LEDs. In 2014, LEDs made up about 5 percent of the American market&#8217;. LEDs reached 15 percent of bulb shipments in the third quarter of last year, a jump of more than 237 percent over the same quarter in 2014.<br />\nThe quality of the product (LED lighting) has improved; simultaneously, prices have fallen; demand soars. A + B = C. It&#8217;s a basic equation you probably learned in Econ 101.<br />\nCities like New York are already ramping up to LEDs.<br />\nIn Manhattan, 250,000 streetlights are on the <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/current-future-populations.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LED upgrade track</a> to be completed by 2017. Again, it&#8217;s a financial move. This will save taxpayers millions of dollars, move us closer to achieving our ambitious sustainability goals, and help us to continue <strong>reducing City government&#8217;s day-to-day costs</strong> and improving its operations, the mayor announced.<br />\nInterestingly, New York&#8217;s 8.5 million <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/current-future-populations.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">residents</a> and 50+ million <a href=\"http://www.nycgo.com/articles/nyc-statistics-page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tourists</a> may not even realize it. Next time you&#8217;re in Central Park, notice the pedestrian-walkway bulbs overhead. They&#8217;re expected to produce <a href=\"https://www.mikebloomberg.com/news/all-250000-nyc-street-lights-will-be-replaced-with-energy-efficient-leds-by-2017/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">up to 62% in energy savings</a>.<br />\nMuch of the world&#8217;s energy innovation is happening behind the scenes, out of many people&#8217;s view. As we write, the <a href=\"http://energysmart.enernoc.com/conference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EnergySMART 2016</a> conference kicks off in Washington, focused on competitive advantage: the rapid change&#8217;an unprecedented pivot in energy management for both enterprises and utilities. Even if you&#8217;re not able to attend, you might want to have a look at the <a href=\"http://www.energysmart.enernoc.com/conference/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">agenda</a>. (And if you <em>are</em> there, don&#8217;t miss WeSpire&#8217;s CEO and Founder Susan Hunt Stevens on Wednesday morning at 10 am EST. She&#8217;s speaking on The Real Business Value of Sustainability, from Recruiting to Improving Your Bottom Line.)<br />\nSometimes behavior changes because individuals decide to take action. Sometimes change happens without individuals even knowing.<br />\nIncreasingly, decision-makers realize clean-energy change is good for the bottom line. The worldwide transition to energy efficiency means that billions of people are part of the solution, and they might not even feel a pinch. If anything, they&#8217;ll notice an improvement: now they have reliable, affordable light and power to make life easier. We say <em>that&#8217;s</em> a painless way to change behavior.<br />\n<em>How about you? Are you interested in improving the energy equation where you work? We&#8217;d love to hear more about that and shed light on the solution WeSpire provides to engage people for good change.</em></p>\n","slug":"money-talks-good-energy-change","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"8e497399-1d08-53cb-95ac-c6fee7b26807"}}}
