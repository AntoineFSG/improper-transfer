In Daniel H. Pink&#8217;s <em>Drive</em>, the 2009 book suggests that Millennials want autonomy, the chance to get better at what they do, and a purpose that connects them to something larger. Gone are the days when a competitive salary, an office in the suburbs, casual Fridays, and a chance to work your way up the corporate ladder reduced turnover and attracted the best talent.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ModernWorkforce_InfographicHighRes.pdf\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-727 size-large\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ModernWorkforce_InfographicHighRes-622x1024.png\" alt=\"Modern Workforce Infographic\" width=\"622\" height=\"1024\" /></a><br />\nTo remain competitive today, casual dress codes, telecommuting, and metropolitan headquarters get you on par with your competitors. But to differentiate, companies who can clearly articulate a core purpose and goals will attract Millennials with a rallying cry. But it&#8217;s not enough to make the investment to change without a clear understanding of what will provide the pay off.</p>\n<h3>Proof Point No. 1: Stock Performance</h3>\n<p>The best employers are better today because their business leaders are focused on <strong>workplace culture as a competitive tool</strong>. A recent Deloitte study found that since 1998, the 100 Best Companies to Work For have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1. Fortune&#8217;s Best Companies to Work for has ranked Google first six times and their leaders explicitly attribute the company&#8217;s financial performance to its benevolent people practices. It&#8217;s for real. Just look at stock performance of these same companies.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The 100 Best Companies have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1, according to a study by the Russell Investment Group. Companies on this list are shining examples of a different way of doing business that puts to rest the old notion that treating employees well might hurt the bottom line. Indeed, most would agree with the Marriott philosophy: Take care of associates, and they will take care of the customers.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Proof Point No. 2: Culture Drives Talent Acquisition &amp; Retention</h3>\n<p>Leaders who genuinely listen to their employees and craft policies in well-being, sustainability and social responsibility programs lays the foundation for rich company culture where every employee is considered important. Millennials are uncomfortable with rigid, top-down corporate structures and turned off by information silos. They expect a rapid progression aligned to a specific and clearly articulated vision and strategy and constant feedback. In other words, millennials want a management style and corporate culture that is markedly different from anything that has gone before&#8217;one that meets their needs. These are all characteristics that employers can actively address.</p>\n<h3>Proof Point No. 3: Well-Being Programs Increase Employee Engagement</h3>\n<p>When surveying employees on what motivates them at work, <a title=\"Quantum Workplace\" href=\"http://www.quantumworkplace.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quantum Workplace</a>, a leading workplace survey and employee feedback technology company found that engagement is higher when employers care about their well-being. More than three-fourths of engaged employees said they were satisfied with the well-being program benefits their organization provides. What is critical for success of your engagement programming in well-being is employee awareness and ability to participate in the benefits (they are twice as likely to be disengaged compared to those who understand the benefits offered to them).</p>\n","slug":"employee-wellbeing-programs","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"6925b51f-7097-5de0-af4d-acc5e3fc7ff3"}}}
