There is no better way to mark the International Day of Happiness than to have our animated ambassador raise awareness about the importance of addressing climate change to create a safer, more sustainable and happier future for all. &#8211; Secretary Ban Ki-Moon<br />\nWeSpire is excited to partner with Sony, and our new best-friend Red, to support this initiative. We&#8217;ve created an interactive campaign on our cloud-based platform that allows users to take positive actions in a fun and engaging <em>Angry Bird</em> way.
