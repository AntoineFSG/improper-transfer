Here, the author argues that sustainability initiatives within a company should be integrated throughout the business. Why have a stand-alone sustainability report when you can include it in your annual reports? Why have a chief sustainability officer when you can have all c-suite execs support sustainable actions? It might be time to replace the triple bottom line model with one that doesn&#8217;t require CSR to stand on its own.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.inc.com/maureen-kline/3-keys-to-successful-employee-engagement.html \">3 Keys to Successful Employee Engagement</a></h3>\n<p>Susan Hunt Stevens, founder and CEO of WeSpire, has noted <strong>three emerging trends</strong> in order to successfully drive sustainability throughout an organization: 1.) managers cannot ignore employee engagement, but instead, must make it a top priority, 2.) senior management must recognize and promote the importance of transforming their company around purpose, and 3.) CSR programs must offer a variety of options appealing to an array of interests in order to effectively resonate with employees. Following these trends, she notes, will generate the greatest support for millennial workers, who have the potential to transform businesses in positive ways in the upcoming years.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com.au/10-ways-to-make-your-business-more-profitable-by-being-socially-responsible-2015-6\">10 ways to make your business more profitable by being socially responsible</a></h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to ignore that Patagonia has a been a sustainability leader in the business sector by infusing socially responsible practices throughout the core of its business. Even if that means promoting an <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-patagonia-136745\">ad campaign</a> telling consumers to, in fact, <em>not</em> buy their products. In this article, Patagonia environmental strategy director, Jill Dumain, illuminates 10 key areas where businesses should focus their efforts in order to boost their CSR. The highlights? Engage all stakeholders, use the tools available to you, be transparent, and commit to thriving, not just surviving!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3047370/lessons-learned/the-only-type-of-motivation-that-leads-to-success\">The Only Type of Motivation that Leads to Success</a></h3>\n<p>When money isn&#8217;t your motivator, you will get paid more. (Caught you off guard there, didn&#8217;t I?) Although this sounds counterintuitive, recent research has shown that following intrinsic motivators and focusing on the meaning and impact of employees&#8217; work will improve the quality of the work they produce. Although it takes more of a conscious effort to foster intrinsic motivation, employers will find that their efforts pay off in more engaged employees and a higher level of creativity present in the workplace. The key takeaway: intrinsically motivated people contribute more valuable work, thus rendering them more likely to get promoted.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.greenbiz.com/article/why-engaging-employees-sustainability-really-isnt-about-money\">Why engaging employees on sustainability really isn&#8217;t about money</a></h3>\n<p>Is employee sustainability engagement really an indicator of deeper engagement patterns within a company? If so, the author argues that it is productive for organizations to lead their workers into combatting broader societal challenges; however, companies are finding more and more often that monetary incentives are not strong enough motivators for this effort. Thus, firms like PwC and Legrand are getting innovative: from friendly competition to skill-based volunteering, employers are finding ways to connect with each individual&#8217;s interests in order to garner support for sustainable initiatives.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.greenbiz.com/webcast/changing-behavior-through-purposeful-work-journey-100-engagement\">GreenBiz Webinar 6.23</a></h3>\n<p>Join our CEO and Founder, Susan Hunt Stevens, for a <a href=\"http://www.greenbiz.com/webcast/changing-behavior-through-purposeful-work-journey-100-engagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">webinar</a> with GreenBiz on <strong>Tuesday, June 23rd , 1 pm EST</strong> as she discusses best practices for engaging employees through purposeful work.
