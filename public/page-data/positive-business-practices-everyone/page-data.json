She will also have the opportunity to attend an exclusive reception to celebrate the honorable mention we received for our Positive Business Project.<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nThe University of Michigan&#8217;s Ross School of Business defines <a href=\"mailto:http://www.wespire.com/what-is-positihttp://www.wespire.com/what-is-positive-business/ve-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">positive business</a> as the idea that businesses can and should create not just economic value, but also offer great places to work, be good neighbors, and help solve some of the world&#8217;s biggest challenges.<br />\nTo help identify, study, celebrate, and spread positive business in organizations of all types Ross Michigan created the <a href=\"http://positivebusinessproject.com/about/general-overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Positive Business Project</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Does Positive Business Look Like At Our Organization</strong></h3>\n<p>At WeSpire, we talk about positive business a lot, especially when it comes to helping to build a better working world. What we&#8217;ve found is that positivity, in the form of employee recognition can go a long way in building a positive culture and business.<br />\nOne of the positive business projects that we&#8217;re most proud of is the recognition feature, called Kudos, that we built for the WeSpire platform. The Kudos feature gives employees the ability to publicly recognize each other in a professional and social manner. Everyone at the company, from interns all the way up to the CEO, can use the Kudos feature to recognize their coworkers for a job well done.<br />\nWhen an employee is recognized, a post is created on the platform&#8217;s dashboard for all to see. Employees are able to comment and like the post, further helping to build a recognition-rich culture among employees. The Kudos feature empowers employees to communicate, share and publicly recognize the amazing work that their colleagues do every day.<br />\nThis tool has provided the organizations we work with numerous opportunities to celebrate individual, team and company victories no matter how small, and shine a light on all of the great work their teams and employees do.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Last year alone, our Kudos feature was the most used feature on our entire platform.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>What Can Positive Business Look Like At Your Organization</strong></h3>\n<p>If there&#8217;s one thing we like to tell folks who are thinking about creating a recognition program, it&#8217;s to start small and don&#8217;t overthink it. You don&#8217;t have to have a big-budget recognition program in order to build a recognition-rich culture. Give executives or team members opportunities to recognize each other during team meetings, company-wide meetings or via email. All it takes is a few people to get the ball rolling, and from there the positivity is contagious. Make recognition a habit of your own, and others will start to adopt it as well.</p>\n","slug":"positive-business-practices-everyone","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c672e865-3ce8-5d4c-9ad2-0c28840015f5"}}}
