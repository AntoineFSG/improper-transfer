By giving thanks, we help others feel appreciated and remind ourselves of how fortunate we are.<br />\nBut if we want to promote a spirit of generosity, we need to add another custom to the Thanksgiving repertoire.<br />\nAlthough gratitude is a powerful emotion, it&#8217;s also a fleeting one. Research <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/emo/10/2/289/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">shows</a> that when we say thanks, we become motivated to pay back or forward what we&#8217;ve received. Then the emotion fades and the giving stops.<br />\nA few years ago, Jane Dutton and I <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/23/9/1033.short\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">asked</a> people to donate a portion of their money to relief efforts for the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The base rate of giving in a control group was 13%. When we randomly assigned a second group of people to list three things they had received from others, donations climbed to 21%.<br />\nNot bad&#8217; until we saw that a different exercise spiked the giving rate above 46%.<br />\nInstead of reflecting on what they had received, we asked a third group to write down three things that they had <em>contributed</em> to others. Now they saw themselves as givers, and here was a chance to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/12/opinion/sunday/raising-a-moral-child.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">earn that identity</a> by helping victims of a natural disaster.<br />\nGratitude is a temporary emotion. Giving is a lasting value.<br />\nIn <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/23/9/1033.short\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">another experiment</a>, we asked university fundraisers to keep a daily journal about what they had received from others or contributed to others. Over the next two weeks, the fundraisers who reflected on giving increased their total effort by 25%&#8217;and put in 13% more hourly effort than their colleagues who wrote about receiving. Having reminded themselves that they were the kinds of people who cared about others, they became invested in giving more.<br />\nAccording to a popular mantra, we should give without remembering and receive without forgetting. Our research suggests otherwise: we should take the time to remember both what we&#8217;ve given and what we&#8217;ve received.<br />\nSo this Thanksgiving, don&#8217;t just count your blessings. Count your contributions too.<br />\n***<br />\nAdam is a Wharton professor and the author of <a href=\"http://www.adamgrant.net/giveandtake\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">GIVE AND TAKE</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adamgrant.net/originals\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ORIGINALS</a>.
