Another favorite is the assembly worker on the production line of <a href=\"http://www.scania.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scania</a> in Sweden who proudly displayed a tattoo of the company logo on his arm&#8217;a real testament to his pride in the business that makes the best trucks in the world. And it is not just the image of loyal employees that benefits the company. <strong>Organizations with high employee engagement levels report 22% higher productivity than those with low levels </strong>(Source: <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/07/employee-engagement-does-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harvard Business Review</a>).<strong> </strong><br />\n<!--more--><br />\nIt may not be realistic to advocate a proliferation of corporate body-art, but it would be inspiring if we could see more employees having that same level of employee engagement in the company they work for.</p>\n<h3>The Research Behind Corporate Volunteering Programs</h3>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"http://ccbriefing.corporate-citizenship.com/2014/10/03/west-coast-perspectives-sustainability/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post,</a> I argued that successfully executed corporate volunteering programs can be a powerful tool to drive employee engagement. Allow me to elaborate.</p>\n<h4>Corporate volunteering programs lead to greater employee engagement</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://corporate-citizenship.com/knowledge-series/employee-volunteering-the-business-case/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research</a> carried out by Corporate Citizenship some 3 or 4 years ago looked at the business benefits of employee volunteering programs. We tracked the progress of 550 volunteers in sixteen blue-chip companies (including BNY Mellon, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Ernst &amp; Young and Nomura). These volunteers were involved in a range of activities, predominantly in schools and colleges, which involved everything from mentoring young students to taking a leadership role on the school governance body.<br />\nOne of the key findings of our research was that volunteering does indeed lead to greater employee engagement. The majority of people involved in the study reported that their experience of volunteering made them feel more positive across a range of measures including self confidence; a sense of well being and happiness; and pride in and commitment to the company. Specifically, as a result of their volunteering experience, between two-thirds and three-quarters of respondents report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Greater commitment to the company </strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Increased motivation </strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>More pride in the business </strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Higher job satisfaction</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Put simply, volunteers said they gained greatly from the opportunity to do something meaningful that helped others; and that through this experience they feel better about themselves and about the organization they work for. The following quote is typical of many that highlight how CSR employee engagement increases loyalty towards and appreciation of the company:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>With my skills I could work for any company, but I would choose one that ran this sort of program. It sets my company apart as one that is doing its bit for society.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition, it is not just the individual who benefits from the intrinsic value of helping others. Several respondents reported that this feel good factor transfers positively into the workplace.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>No matter how bad a day you are having, once you have visited the school you come back much happier and can have a more productive afternoon&#8217;s work.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition, it&#8217;s also important to recognise the reputational benefits for the business associated with corporate volunteering programs. We all know that in today&#8217;s environment a company needs to be seen as a good corporate citizen, not only to consumers, but prospective employees. Investing directly in the local community in which you operate is one of the most obvious ways of demonstrating your commitment to corporate responsibility or citizenship.</p>\n<h3>Making the Business Case for Corporate Volunteering Programs</h3>\n<p>Finally, but perhaps most important, there are the positive social benefits that stem from the skills, experience and knowledge that community partners gain from employees giving their time and effort. Obviously, this is of huge value to everyone involved. It is vital that these positive returns are not forgotten when we consider the benefits associated with a volunteering program.<br />\nThere is a clear business case for a well executed, well managed program that gets employees involved in company-supported activities with community partners. These programs can drive employee engagement in a way that few other initiatives are able to achieve. While it might not result in the absolute devotion shown in the Scania (tattoo) example, it does make current and potential employees view the company in a more positive light. And that can be a crucial differentiator in recruiting and retaining the best people.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><a href=\"/platform\"><img class=\"   alignleft wp-image-285\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/volunteering-copy-300x300.png\" alt=\"corporate volunteering programs page\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a>Check out <a href=\"/platform\">WeSpire&#8217;s platform page</a> to learn more about partnering with WeSpire for your corporate volunteering programs.</em></p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><img title=\"Andrew Wilson\" src=\"http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/217956/file-2027726134-jpg/Andrew_Wilson_1.jpg?t=1423778295545\" alt=\"Andrew Wilson\" align=\"left\" />Andrew Wilson</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">An economist by training, Andrew has a 20-year track record in consulting on sustainable development.
