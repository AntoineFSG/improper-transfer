WeSpire goes beyond tracking employee engagement to offer a broad platform focused on changing behaviors&#8217;and with that comes a Customer Success team with a dedicated manager just for you.<br />\nEmployee engagement, everyone wants to do something to improve it, but few have a clear prescriptive strategy on exactly how to do it and where to start. The WeSpire Customer Success team has years of experience under their belt at helping organizations take the first bite of the proverbial employee engagement apple. Here are three tips from our team of experts to help you ensure your employee engagement strategy is successful:<br />\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>1. Establish concrete objectives:</strong></span><br />\nWe&#8217;d be willing to bet your organization has set aggressive goals such as becoming carbon neutral by 2020 or perhaps increasing this year&#8217;s employee engagement score by 10 points. These are world-class, big-picture goals, but the road to accomplishing these goals needs to consist of smaller actions that contribute to the larger vision.<br />\nDo you know what success looks like for your each of your employee engagement campaigns? Start off each of your efforts with achievable goals that serve as agents for the larger goal in view.<br />\nCurrent examples from WeSpire&#8217;s Behavioral-Science Project Library:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Motivate employees to exercise for 30 minutes a day 5 days a week for a month</li>\n<li>Phase out paper cups and transition a regional network of offices to reusable cups over 6 months</li>\n<li>Pump-up enthusiasm on a talented but disconnected group of remote workers</li>\n<li>Hit a 92% <em>I read it!</em> rate for your new Corporate Social Responsibility report</li>\n<li>Get 50 registrations for a volunteering project happening in April</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are just a few of the real campaigns that WeSpire customers are actively pursuing on the platform today. Set your goal then choose actions from among hundreds of constructive projects that can make it happen!<br />\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>To do:</strong></span> Before you launch your campaign, get everyone on the same page. Once stakeholders have a clear understanding of goals, and have contributed to their formulation, start assembling your tool box.<a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/volunteer-at-pine-st.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1508 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/volunteer-at-pine-st-300x131.png\" alt=\"volunteer at pine st\" width=\"300\" height=\"131\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/join-summer-living.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-1507 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/join-summer-living-300x155.png\" alt=\"join summer living\" width=\"266\" height=\"137\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Connect all messaging, incentives, actions, and analytics&#8217;and use them to build your story.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>2. Serve personalized choices</strong></span><br />\nLife is complicated. People are busy. Give your employees a break! And, give them a choice. Passion isn&#8217;t a one-stop shop, so serve up a portfolio of opportunities to give your employees a chance to select. Exercise, energy efficiency, volunteering, mindfulness, budgeting, healthy eating: it&#8217;s empowering to pick something that really resonates.<br />\nWhen people have a positive first experience, they come back for more. And more. Your employees will feel a deeper connection to your organization if they feel the topics they value are also valued by your organization. Great employee engagement programs have something for everyone.<br />\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>3. Lower the Barrier-to-Entry</strong></span><br />\nAn employee engagement program isn&#8217;t going to have a lot of engagement going on if your employees have to put a lot of skin in the game to get started. Action is what it&#8217;s all about, right? Once an employee has taken one action they are much more likely to take another and the level of difficulty of the tasks they are willing to complete also increases. Don&#8217;t create your engagement program with the idea that each of your employees is going to pick up football fields worth of trash to clean up your community. You&#8217;ll get there eventually but you need to build up to that point. We&#8217;re building a community here, folks! Let&#8217;s just make it easy for them.<br />\n<strong>That is NOT all, but it&#8217;s a good start</strong>. <em>What&#8217;s something you wish you knew before you started putting together your employee engagement strategy?
