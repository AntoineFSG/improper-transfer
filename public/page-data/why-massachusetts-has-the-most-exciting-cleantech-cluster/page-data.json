Cleantech companies in Massachusetts are thriving, with a <strong>47% growth rate and</strong> <strong>100,000 employees by 2015.</strong><!--more--><br />\nI was honored to be the CEO chosen to represent Cleantech companies in Massachusetts and celebrate Massachusetts&#8217; continued progress in building the most exciting clean-tech community in the world. I also had the rare opportunity to share WeSpire&#8217;s journey and how founding our company in Massachusetts has helped us succeed. Here are a few reasons I gave to explain why Massachusetts is such an exciting place to raise a clean-tech startup:</p>\n<h4><strong>An educated and passionate workforce</strong></h4>\n<p>When starting out, I tapped first into our strong university sector: hiring students from BU&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/earth/\">School of the Environment</a> to do research, hiring Co-ops from <a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/\">Northeastern</a> for marketing and computer science, and attracting a lifecycle scientist from <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/\">MIT</a> to create our scoring system. We took advantage of the strong local tech scene and convinced outstanding engineers from regular tech startups that they could not only write great code, but in the process work on something really meaningful and important. And as we&#8217;ve continued to grow our team, we&#8217;ve benefitted from the fabulous MassCEC intern program&#8217;and hired several of the interns as employees.</p>\n<h4><strong>Investors and customers who share our values</strong></h4>\n<p>When we needed capital, we got backed first by <a href=\"http://commonangels.com/\">CommonAngels</a> and then the <a href=\"http://www.cleanenergyvg.com/\">Clean Energy Venture Group</a> and <a href=\"http://launchpadventuregroup.com/\">Launchpad Venture Group</a>&#8216;three local angel groups who not only provide capital, but expertise and connections to customers and new team members. When we started offering our platform to companies to use with their employees, <a href=\"http://www.enernoc.com/\">EnerNOC</a>&#8216;truly a pillar company in our sector&#8217;became our first customer. <a href=\"http://www.ca.com/us/default.aspx\">CA Technologies</a> in Framingham became our first Fortune 500 customer and we now work with over 30 global customers who collectively have 2MM employees. Our most recent exciting news is that EnerNOC has gone from first customer to an investor and partner, and will now be offering our software to their customers.</p>\n<h4><strong> </strong><strong>A mission-driven leadership and community</strong></h4>\n<p>What is immeasurable is the impact of the people here in Massachusetts who have helped informally. Many have recommended potential employees, nominated us for awards, introduced us to their college roommate who happens to be a Chief Sustainability Officer, written <a href=\"/blog\">blog posts</a>, or commiserated over coffee about start-up growing pains. They are part of a thriving eco-system that helps Cleantech companies in Massachusetts succeed.<br />\nI spend most of my time with the sustainability leaders of large global corporations.  They recognize that Massachusetts is leading the nation and this world on all fronts&#8217;policy, research &amp; development, commercialization, and adoption of the technologies in this critical, booming sector. We are blessed to be citizens of a state where leadership just gets it.  We are in a state where people increasingly understand that the transition to a cleaner economy is very, very good for business.<br />\nOne of my favorite sayings is that it takes a village to raise a start-up. I feel very fortunate that my village is the state of Massachusetts.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\"  alignleft wp-image-335\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire blog about cleantech companies in Massachusetts\" width=\"175\" height=\"62\" /></a><a title=\"Blog\" href=\"/blog\">Subscribe to the WeSpire blog</a></em><em> for updates on our award-winning employee engagement platform and ways that you can partner with WeSpire drive measurable, positive impact through your organization.</em></p></blockquote>\n","slug":"why-massachusetts-has-the-most-exciting-cleantech-cluster","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f6e37b3d-8954-5f7d-acde-0e750a9b2d8c"}}}
