What&#8217;s more, the 60% of companies that do not offer these programs are suffering because of it: each employee who experiences severe financial stress<em> <strong>costs a company $5,000-$7,000 annually in lost productivity</strong></em>. Financial wellness has the potential to be a powerful employee engagement program, as financially capable employees are more satisfied, engaged, and more productive in their workdays.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-21/how-happy-do-weekends-actually-make-us-\">How Happy Do Weekends Actually Make Us?</a></h3>\n<p>The National Bureau of Economic Research recently compiled 4 years of Gallup&#8217;s data from full- and part- time workers with the objective of identifying emotional trends throughout the workweek. <strong>The results were surprising</strong>: for workers who reported an overall favorable workplace environment, their answers did not differ on the weekends versus during the workweek. All other employees reported a significant happiness jump on the weekends. What&#8217;s more, the case for supportive manager-employee relationships was evident in the data: when workers saw their managers as partners, not just bosses, they experienced as much social fulfillment as they typically do with friends over the weekend. Bottom line: supportive workplaces yield happier, more engaged employees.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.triplepundit.com/special/roi-of-sustainability/4-ways-to-make-your-sustainability-programs-downsize-proof/\">4 Ways to Make Your Sustainability Programs Downsize-Proof</a></h3>\n<p>Sustainability programs, like most business initiatives, are not immune to cost-cutting during tighter economic times (some would argue that they are even more susceptible). As such, leaders should design their sustainability programs to achieve maximum returns with a limited number of resources in mind, and the author outlines <strong>four specific strategies</strong> leaders can take in this regard. Our favorite was ensuring that your program caters to learning effects &#8216; if your sustainability program teaches valuable skills for participating employees, it is more likely to survive the budget-cut chopping block.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-kohll/does-participation-or-eng_b_7849440.html\">Does Participation or Engagement Drive Success in Corporate Wellness?</a></h3>\n<p>Participation and engagement are not the same thing: participating employees will sign up, complete the initial health screening and participate in some events, but they will not go above and beyond. Engaged employees, however, will set goals for themselves, continue striving for healthier lifestyles, and opt in with extra effort. These engaged employees will be the lifeblood of your program, so it is key for employers to foster engagement, not just participation. The article offers <em><strong>five specific tips for boosting engagement</strong></em> in your corporate wellness program, from setting specific goals to rewarding improvement.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/justin-rosenstein/effective-feedback_b_7781054.html\">Blunt, Effective Feedback, in 3 Stories </a></h3>\n<p>Research has proven that in workplaces where managers do not provide feedback for employees, engagement rates clock in at a dismal 29%. <strong><em>When feedback is regularly provided, however, employees have 79% engagement rate.</em></strong> With a differential like that, there must be a strong reason why managers are hesitant to give criticism: it is rare that they give it in a manner that can be well-received. The author outlines <strong>three insightful strategies</strong> to framing your feedback so that you can coach your employees to reach their best potential, keep your team cohesive with successful mediation, and illuminate problems without sounding accusatory.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"/blog\"><img class=\" wp-image-335 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.wespire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/The-WeSpire-blog-image-300x106.png\" alt=\"The WeSpire blog image\" width=\"175\" height=\"62\" /></a>Visit the <a href=\"/blog\">WeSpire blog</a> and subscribe to get the latest employee engagement articles delivered straight into your inbox.</p></blockquote>\n","slug":"employee-engagement-weekly-news-roundup-7242015","featured_media":null},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"41b790df-a0e5-5203-afe3-ccf4e0a45dad"}}}
