Now you do!</strong> </em><br />\n<!--more--><br />\nLeap Year is an <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/29/tech/why-do-we-have-leap-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">actuarial phenomenon</a> that occurs every four years. Other four-year spans come to mind: graduating from college; U.S. presidential elections; the Olympics.<br />\nLeap Year is different: We don&#8217;t train for the bonus day, even though we all surely appreciate it.<br />\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\">With our shared Leap Day in mind, here are 4 prompts on how you might spend it wisely&#8217;and bounce into March recharged.</span><br />\nSo let&#8217;s pick a thing lots of people are fixed on: #Careerlove. I.e., <em>How to find the work you love</em>. Managers translate this to <em>employee engagement</em>. And Chief Financial Officers translate this to a $600 Billion annual global problem.<br />\nThe good news is we are solving for this all day, every day at WeSpire.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Leap:</strong></span> Take that word LEAP seriously and identify a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BHAG</a> challenge to leap ahead in a direction you know you want. <em>Here&#8217;s the WeSpire twist</em>: why not formulate a goal that aligns with your company: the business it&#8217;s in; the people it serves; its culture, goals, and aspirations. Think that&#8217;s too narrow? Think again: most businesses today want you to be happy, healthy, fit, prepared, resilient, on-task. All of it. Because the boss knows a highly engaged workforce is going to succeed.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Purpose:</strong></span> Name yours. Then find people who share it. If you can find an employer who speaks the language, that&#8217;s ideal. Plug into their <a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/investor-relations/annual-report-and-accounts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">annual reports</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/corporate-responsibility-and-the-long-view/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">letters from</a> the <a href=\"http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2015ltr.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chairman</a>. You will find that global business leaders are searching for lasting new ways to engage employees on purpose. The benefits are clear, and they are the essence of sustainability: <strong>&#8220;People with purpose get out of bed more inspired and return more fulfilled. Their careers are more rewarding, their businesses more impactful.&#8221;</strong> (From LinkedIn&#8217;s elegant <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-first-ad-the-oscars-space-astronauts-2016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new campaign</a> launched during the Oscars and trumpeted in the media this week.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Team:</strong></span> Another reason people enjoy their jobs: a positive team experience. Increasingly managers understand that successful teams are performance gold: Within companies and conglomerates, as well as in government agencies and schools, teams are now the fundamental unit of organization. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html\">together</a></em>.    But how to create a good team? For guidance, we are drawn to investigating the heads of successful teams, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sarah-finnie-robinson/super-bowl-coaches-provide-insights-on-star-performance-and-teamwork_b_9178088.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Superbowl coaches</a> for instance.  For more, check out Google&#8217;s Project Aristotle, a centerpiece of the New York Times&#8217;s current <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Work Issue</a>. Project Aristotle is an exhaustive inquiry on what makes a successful team, and the quick answer is <em>social norms</em>. Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.     P.S. WeSpire&#8217;s architecture is designed to leverage the power of social norms to create lasting behavior change, and we have <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">case studies</a> to prove it.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Tools:</strong> </span>Get the ones you need. <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slack</a> is our office darling. In case you are visiting from the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Slack is the 2-year old social network that, simply put, makes people love their work experience, and it&#8217;s all about teams (please see above). Yes, WeSpire&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/employee-engagement-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">platform</a> integrates beautifully with Slack and other popular <a href=\"http://www.wespire.com/resource/wespire-connects-how-wespires-platform-integrates-with-other-technology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">workplace networks</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> The year 2016 just delivered a great gift: 24 extra hours to do anything you want!
