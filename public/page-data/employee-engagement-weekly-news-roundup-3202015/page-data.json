The report, &#8220;Total Rewards and Employee Well-Being Practices,&#8221; found that 74% report that they plan to increase their well-being offerings or activities in the next two years. Perhaps the most exciting finding is that there is a correlation between integrated well-being approaches (programs that span across health, fitness and safety) and lower rates of employee turnover&#8217;paying attention to all aspects of employee health pays off!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/deloitte/2015/03/16/the-last-mile-problem-how-data-science-and-behavioral-science-can-work-together/\">The Last-Mile Problem: How Data Science and Behavioral Science Can Work Together</a></h3>\n<p>The author, a highly regarded Deloitte consultant, makes a strong case towards changing the focus from data capture to data delivery in order to get people to change behavior for the better.

He went on to debunk the following myths: 1) Purpose is a cause, 2) There are &#8220;purpose&#8221; jobs, 3) Purpose is easy, 4) Purpose is a luxury, and 5) Purpose is a revelation. Once you accept what it takes to execute on building purpose in the workplace, you can empower your organization to thrive off of it.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/03/positive-teams-are-more-productive\">Positive Teams Are More Productive</a></h3>\n<p>Instead of turning to traditional methods of increasing productivity&#8217;strategy planning, goal-setting, etc.&#8217;researchers at the University of Michigan recommend striving to create a workplace characterized by positive and virtuous practices, such as caring for colleagues as friends, avoiding blame and forgiving mistakes, and creating an environment of respect. Now that&#8217;s all nice in theory, but how do you put it into practice?

So put time into matching them with your best managers, give them the freedom to work on things they are good at and enjoy, and utilize creative technologies to engage them further.
