How great is that!? This may sound spoiled to some.</p>\n<p>I like to approach every new task as a juncture to explore a more effective and creative outcome. My aim is to achieve 3 goals; make it easier to use, make it simpler to understand, and make it interesting. I strive to go beyond just meeting the clients needs. I hope to have the audience enjoy the content of the experience, not just see it or click it.</p>\n<p>For the last 10 years I’ve been working with clients directly as a long-time freelancer, and at agencies with creative directors, project managers, developers, copywriters, strategists, and of coarse account managers. As a self employed designer, I’ve managed contractors of my own. I’ve created content and user experiences for national brands and for local businesses in a wide range of digital and print media.</p>\n<p><em>Now a long list of all the things I do in no particular order: branding, social media content, UX, UI, information architecture, visual design, emails, banners and all things digital advertising, concepting, catchy slogans, infographics, presentations, charts, all types of print media, media kits, brochures, booklets, cards, posters, stickers, packaging design, logos, apparel graphics, pins &amp; buttons, out-of-home, in-store, hand drawn type, illustrations, story boarding, wire frames, mobile apps and more</em></p>\n<p>I’m never not making something.

I also love skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, biking, and walking with my wife and dachshund.</p>\n<p>You can explore some of my <span style=\"color: #66bb46;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #66bb46;\" href=\"http://www.brooklynstreetart.com/tag/ian-pop-mortem-mcgillivray/\">art,</a> <a style=\"color: #66bb46;\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/improperdesign/\">inspiration,</a></strong></span> or just plain <span style=\"color: #99cc00;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #99cc00;\" href=\"http://fartropolis.tumblr.com/\"><span style=\"color: #66bb46;\">silliness.</span> </a></strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f311eeb3-a8ca-574b-8340-6b8354d96f2f"}}}
